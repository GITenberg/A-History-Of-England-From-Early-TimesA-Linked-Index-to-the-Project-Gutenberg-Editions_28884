<h2>
    STATE OF PARTIES.
</h2>
<p>
It may be necessary to remind the reader of the state of parties at this
important juncture. The Jacobites had been fed with hopes of seeing the
succession altered by the earl of Oxford. These hopes he had conveyed
to them in a distant, undeterminate, and mysterious manner, without any
other view than that of preventing them from taking violent measures to
embarrass his administration. At least, if he actually entertained at
one time any other design, he had, long before his disgrace, laid it
wholly aside, probably from an apprehension of the danger with which it
must have been attended, and seemed bent upon making a merit of his zeal
for the house of Hanover; but his conduct was so equivocal and unsteady,
that he ruined himself in the opinion of one party without acquiring
the confidence of the other. The friends of the pretender derived fresh
hopes from the ministry of Bolingbroke. Though he had never explained
himself on this subject, he was supposed to favour the heir of blood,
and known to be an implacable enemy to the whigs, who were the most
zealous advocates for the protestant succession. The Jacobites promised
themselves much from his affection, but more from his resentment; and
they believed the majority of the tories would join them on the
same maxims. All Bolingbroke's schemes of power were defeated by the
promotion of the duke of Shrewsbury to the office of treasurer; and all
his hopes blasted by the death of the queen, on whose personal favour
he depended. The resolute behaviour of the dukes of Somerset and Argyle,
together with the diligence and activity of a council in which the
whig interest had gained the ascendancy, completed the confusion of the
tories, who found themselves without a head, divided, distracted, and
irresolute. Upon recollection, they saw nothing so eligible as silence
and submission to those measures which they could not oppose with any
prospect of success. They had no other objection to the succession in
the house of Hanover but the fear of seeing the whig faction once more
predominant; yet they were not without hope that their new sovereign,
who was reputed a prince of sagacity and experience, would cultivate
and conciliate the affection of the tories, who were the landholders and
proprietors of the kingdom, rather than declare himself the head of a
faction which leaned for support on those who were enemies to the church
and monarchy, on the bank and the monied interest, raised upon usury
and maintained by corruption. In a word, the whigs were elated and
overbearing; the tories abashed and humble; the Jacobites eager,
impatient, and alarmed at a juncture which, with respect to them, was
truly critical.

<h2>
    KING GEORGE PROCLAIMED.
</h2>
<p>
The queen had no sooner resigned her last breath than the privy-council
met, and the archbishop of Canterbury, the lord-chancellor, and the
Hanoverian resident, Kreyenburgh, produced the three instruments in
which the elector of Brunswick had nominated the persons * to be added
as lords-justices to the seven great officers of the realm.
</p>

Orders were immediately issued for proclaiming king George in England,
Scotland, and Ireland. The regency appointed the earl of Dorset to carry
to Hanover the intimation of his majesty's accession, and attend him
in his journey to England. They sent the general officers in whom they
could confide to their respective posts; they reinforced the garrison
of Portsmouth; they appointed Mr. Addison their secretary; while
Bolingbroke was obliged to stand at the door of the council-chamber with
his bag and papers, and underwent every species of mortification. On
the whole, king George ascended the throne of Great Britain in the
fifty-fifth year of his age, without the least opposition, tumult, or
sign of popular discontent; and the unprejudiced part of the nation was
now fully persuaded that no design had ever been concerted by Queen
Anne and her ministry in favour of the pretender. The mayor of Oxford
received a letter, requiring him to proclaim the pretender. This being
communicated to the vice-chancellor, a copy of it was immediately
transmitted to Mr. secretary Bromley, member of Parliament for the
university; and the vice-chancellor offered a reward of one hundred
pounds to any person who should discover the author. It was either the
production of some lunatic, or a weak contrivance to fix an odium on
that venerable body.

<h2>
    THE CIVIL LIST GRANTED TO THE KING.
</h2>
<p>
The parliament having assembled pursuant to the act which regulated
the succession, the lord chancellor, on the fifth day of August, made a
speech to both houses in the name of the regency. He told them that the
privy-council appointed by the elector of Brunswick had proclaimed
that prince under the name of king George, as the lawful and rightful
sovereign of these kingdoms; and that they had taken the necessary care
to maintain the public peace. He observed, that the several branches of
the public revenue were expired by the demise of her late majesty; and
recommended to the commons the making such provision, in that respect,
as might be requisite to support the honour and dignity of the crown. He
likewise expressed his hope that they would not be wanting in anything
that might conduce to the establishing and advancing of the public
credit. Both houses immediately agreed to addresses, containing the
warmest expressions of duty and affection to their new sovereign,
who did not fail to return such answers as were very agreeable to the
parliament of Great Britain. In the meantime the lower house prepared
and passed a bill, granting to his majesty the same civil list which the
queen had enjoyed, with additional clauses for the payment of arrears
due to the troops of Hanover which had been in the service of Great
Britain; and for a reward of one hundred thousand pounds, to be paid
by the treasury to any person who should apprehend the pretender in
landing, or attempting to land, in any part of the British dominions.
Mr. Craggs, who had been despatched to Hanover before the queen died,
returning on the thirteenth day of August with letters from the king to
the regency, they went to the house of peers; then the chancellor,
in another speech to both houses, intimated his majesty's great
satisfaction in the loyalty and affection which his people had
universally expressed at his accession. Other addresses were voted on
this occasion. The commons finished the bill for the civil list, and
one for making some alterations in an act for a state-lottery, which
received the royal assent from the lords-justices. Then the parliament
was prorogued.

<h2>
    THE ELECTORAL PRINCE CREATED PRINCE OF WALES.
</h2>
<p>
Mr. Prior having notified the queen's death to the court of Versailles,
Louis declared that he would inviolably maintain the treaty of peace
concluded at Utrecht, particularly with relation to the settlement of
the British crown in the house of Hanover. The earl of Strafford having
signified the same event to the states of Holland, and the resident of
Hanover having presented them with a letter, in which his master claimed
the performance of their guarantee, they resolved to perform their
engagements, and congratulated his electoral highness on his succession
to the throne of Great Britain. They invited him to pass through their
dominions, and assured him that his interests were as dear to them as
their own. The chevalier de St. George no sooner received the news of
the queen's death, than he posted to Versailles, where he was given
to understand that the king of France expected he should quit his
territories immediately; and he was accordingly obliged to return to
Lorraine. By this time Mr. Murray had arrived in England from Hanover,
with notice that the king had deferred his departure for some days.
He brought orders to the regency to prepare a patent for creating the
prince-royal prince of Wales; and for removing lord Bolingbroke from his
post of secretary. The seals were taken from this minister by the dukes
of Shrewsbury and Somerset, and lord Cowper, who at the same time sealed
up all the doors of his office.

<h2>
    THE KING ARRIVES IN ENGLAND.
</h2>
<p>
King George having vested the government of his German dominions in a
council, headed by his brother prince Ernest, set out with the electoral
prince from Herenhausen on the thirty-first day of August; and in fire
days arrived at the Hague, where he conferred with the states-general.
On the sixteenth day of September he embarked at Orange Polder, under
convoy of an English and Dutch squadron, commanded by the earl of
Berkeley, and next day arrived at the Hope. In the afternoon the yacht
sailed up the river; and his majesty, with the prince, were landed from
a barge at Greenwich about six in the evening. There he was received by
the duke of Northumberland, captain of the life-guards, and the lords of
the regency. From the landing place he walked to his house in the park,
accompanied by a great number of the nobility and other persons of
distinction, who had the honour to kiss his hand as they approached.
When he retired to his bed-chamber, he sent for those of the nobility
who had distinguished themselves by their zeal for his succession; but
the duke of Ormond, the lord-chancellor, and lord Trevor, were not of
the number. Next morning the earl of Oxford presented himself with an
air of confidence, as if he had expected to receive some particular
mark of his majesty's favour; but he had the mortification to remain
a considerable time undistinguished among the crowd, and then was
permitted to kiss the king's hand without being honoured with any other
notice. On the other hand, his majesty expressed uncommon regard for the
duke of Marlborough, who had lately arrived in England, as well as for
all the leaders of the whig party.

<h2>
    THE TORIES TOTALLY EXCLUDED FROM THE ROYAL FAVOUR.
</h2>
<p>
It was the misfortune of this prince, as well as a very great prejudice
to the nation, that he had been misled into strong prepossessions
against the tories, who constituted such a considerable part of his
subjects. They were now excluded from all share of the royal favour,
which was wholly engrossed by their enemies; these early marks of
aversion, which he was at no pains to conceal, alienated the minds of
many from his person and government, who would otherwise have served
him with fidelity and affection. An instantaneous and total change was
effected in all offices of honour and advantage. The duke of Ormond
was dismissed from his command, which the king restored to the duke of
Marlborough, whom he likewise appointed colonel of the first regiment
of foot guards, and master of the ordnance. The great seal was given to
lord Cowper; the privy seal to the earl of Wharton; the government
of Ireland to the earl of Sunderland. The duke of Devonshire was made
steward of the household; lord Townshend and Mr. Stanhope were appointed
secretaries of state; the post of secretary for Scotland was bestowed
upon the duke of Montrose. The duke of Somerset was constituted master
of the horse; the duke of St. Alban's captain of the band of pensioners;
and the duke of Argyle commander-in-chief of the forces in Scotland.
Mr. Pulteney became secretary at war; and Mr. Walpole, who had already
undertaken to manage the house of commons, was gratified with the
double place of paymaster to the army and to Chelsea-hospital. A
new privy-council was appointed, and the earl of Nottingham declared
president; but all affairs of consequence were concerted by a
cabinet-council, or junto, composed of the duke of Marlborough, the
earls of Nottingham and Sunderland, the lords Halifax, Townshend,
and Somers, and general Stanhope. The regency had already removed sir
Constantine Phipps and the archbishop of Armagh from the office of
lords-justices in Ireland, and filled their places in the regency of
that kingdom with the archbishop of Dublin and tire earl of Kildare.
Allan Broderick was appointed chancellor; another privy-council was
formed, and the duke of Ormond was named as one of the members. The
treasury and admiralty were put into commission; all the governments
were changed; and, in a word, the whole nation was delivered into the
hands of the whigs. At the same time the prince-royal was declared
prince of Wales, and took his place in council. The king was
congratulated on his accession in addresses from the two universities,
and from all the cities and corporations in the kingdom. He expressed
particular satisfaction at these expressions of loyalty and affection.
He declared in council his firm purpose to support and maintain the
churches of England and Scotland as they were by law established; an aim
which he imagined might be effectually accomplished, without impairing
the toleration allowed by law to protestant dissenters, and so necessary
to the trade and riches of the kingdom; he, moreover, assured them he
would earnestly endeavour to render property secure; the good effects of
which were no where so clearly seen as in this happy nation. Before the
coronation he created some new peers, and others were promoted to higher
titles.* On the twentieth day of October he was crowned in Westminster
with the usual solemnity, at which the earl of Oxford and lord
Bolingbroke assisted.**

On that very day the university of Oxford, in full convocation,
unanimously conferred the degree of doctor of civil law on sir

French king was said to protract the demolition of Dunkirk, Mr. Prior
received orders to present a memorial to hasten this work, and to
prevent the canal of Mardyke from being finished. The answer which he
received being deemed equivocal, this minister was recalled, and the
earl of Stair appointed ambassador to the court of France, where he
prosecuted this affair with uncommon vigour. About the same time
general Cadogan was sent as plenipotentiary to Antwerp, to assist at
the barrier-treaty, negotiated there between the emperor and the
states-general.

<h2>
    PRETENDER'S MANIFESTO.
</h2>
<p>
Meanwhile the number of malcontents in England was considerably
increased by the king's attachment to the whig faction. The clamour
of the church's being in danger was revived; jealousies were excited;
seditious libels dispersed; and dangerous tumults raised in different
parts of the kingdom. Birmingham, Bristol, Chippenham, Norwich, and
Reading, were filled with licentious riot. The party cry was, "Down with
the whigs! Sacheverel for ever!" Many gentlemen of the whig faction were
abused; magistrates in towns, and justices in the country, were reviled
and insulted by the populace in the execution of their office. The
pretender took this opportunity to transmit, by the French mail, copies
of a printed manifesto to the dukes of Shrewsbury, Marlborough, Argyle,
and other noblemen of the first distinction. In this declaration he
mentioned the good intentions of his sister towards him, which were
prevented by her deplorable death. He observed that his people, instead
of doing him and themselves justice, had proclaimed for their king a
foreign prince, contrary to the fundamental and incontestable laws of
hereditary right, which their pretended acts of settlement could never
abrogate. These papers being delivered to the secretaries of state, the
king refused an audience to the marquis de Lamberti, minister from the
duke of Lorraine, on the supposition that this manifesto could not have
been prepared or transmitted without the knowledge and countenance of
his master. The marquis having communicated this circumstance to
the duke, that prince absolutely denied his having been privy to the
transaction, and declared that the chevalier de St. George came into
Lorraine by the directions of the French king, whom the duke could not
disoblige without exposing his territories to invasion. Notwithstanding
this apology, the marquis was given to understand that he could not be
admitted to an audience until the pretender should be removed from
the dominions of his master; he therefore quitted the kingdom without
further hesitation. Religion was still mingled in all political
disputes. The high churchmen complained that impiety and heresy daily
gained ground from the connivance, or at least the supine negligence,
of the whig prelates. The lower house of convocation had, before the
queen's death, declared that a book published by Dr. Samuel Clarke,
under the title of "The Scripture Doctrine of the Trinity," contained
assertions contrary to the catholic faith. They sent up extracts from
this performance to the bishops, and the doctor wrote an answer to
their objections. He was prevailed upon to write an apology, which he
presented to the upper house; but apprehending it might be published
separately, and misunderstood, he afterwards delivered an explanation
to the bishop of London. This was satisfactory to the bishops; but
the lower house resolved that it was no recantation of his heretical
assertions. The disputes about the Trinity increasing, the archbishops
and bishops received directions, which were published, for preserving
unity in the church, the purity of the christian faith concerning the
holy Trinity, and for maintaining the peace and quiet of the state. By
these every preacher was restricted from delivering any other doctrine
than what is contained in the holy scriptures with respect to the
Trinity, and from intermeddling in any affairs of state or government.
The like prohibition was extended to those who should write, harangue,
or dispute on the same subjects.

<h2>
    NEW PARLIAMENT.
</h2>
<p>
The parliament being dissolved, another was called by a very
extraordinary proclamation, in which the king complained of the evil
designs of men disaffected to his succession; and of their having
misrepresented his conduct and principles. He mentioned the perplexity
of public affairs, the interruption of commerce, and the heavy debts of
the nation. He expressed his hope that his loving subjects would send up
to parliament the fittest persons to redress the present disorders; and
that in the elections, they would have a particular regard to such as
had expressed a firm attachment to the protestant succession when it was
in danger. It does not appear that the protestant succession was ever
in danger. How then was this declaration to be interpreted? People in
general construed it into a design to maintain party distinctions,
and encourage the whigs to the full exertion of their influence in the
elections; into a renunciation of the tories; and as the first flash of
that vengeance which afterwards was seen to burst upon the heads of the
late ministry. When the earl of Strafford returned from Holland, all his
papers were seized by an order from the secretary's office. Mr. Prior
was recalled from France, and promised to discover all he knew relating
to the conduct of Oxford's administration. Uncommon vigour was exerted
on both sides in the elections; but, by dint of the monied interest,
which prevailed in most of the corporations through the kingdom, and the
countenance of the ministry, which will always have weight with needy
and venal electors, a great majority of whigs was returned both in
England and Scotland.

<h2>
    THE KING'S FIRST SPEECH.
</h2>
<p>
When this new parliament assembled on the seventeenth day of March, at
Westminster, Mr. Spencer Compton was chosen speaker of the commons. On
the twenty-first day of the month, the king appeared in the house of
lords and delivered to the chancellor a written speech, which was read
in presence of both houses. His majesty thanked his faithful and loving
subjects for that zeal and firmness they had shown in defence of the
protestant succession, against all the open and secret practices which
had been used to defeat it. He told them that some conditions of the
peace, essential to the security and trade of Great Britain, were not
yet duly executed; and that the performance of the whole might be
looked upon as precarious, until defensive alliances should be formed to
guarantee the present treaties. He observed, that the pretender
boasted of the assistance he expected in England, to repair his former
disappointment; that great part of the national trade was rendered
impracticable; and that the public debts were surprisingly increased
ever since the fatal cessation of arms. He gave the commons to
understand that the branches of the revenue, formerly granted for the
support of the civil government, were so far encumbered and alienated,
that the produce of the funds which remained, and had been granted to
him, would fall short of what was at first designed for maintaining the
honour and dignity of the crown; that as it was his and their happiness
to see a prince of Wales who might in due time succeed him on the
throne, and to see him blessed with many children, these circumstances
would naturally occasion an expense to which the nation had not been for
many years accustomed; and, therefore, he did not doubt but they would
think of it with that affection which he had reason to hope from his
commons. He desired that no unhappy divisions of parties might divert
them from pursuing the common interests of their country. He declared
that the established constitution in church and state should be the rule
of his government; and that the happiness, ease, and prosperity of
his people should be the chief care of his life. He concluded with
expressing his confidence, that with their assistance he should
disappoint the designs of those who wanted to deprive him of that
blessing which he most valued&mdash;the affection of his people.
</p>
<p>
Speeches suggested by a vindictive ministry better became the leader of
an incensed party, than the father and sovereign of a divided people.
This declaration portended measures which it was the interest of the
crown to avoid, and suited the temper of the majority in both houses,
which breathed nothing but destruction to their political adversaries.
The lords, in their address of thanks, professed their hope that his
majesty, assisted by the parliament, would be able to recover the
reputation of the kingdom in foreign parts, the loss of which they hoped
to convince the world by their actions was by no means to be imputed to
the nation in general. The tories said this was an invidious reflection,
calculated to mislead and inflame the people, for the reputation of the
kingdom had never been so high as at this very juncture. The commons
pretended astonishment to find that any conditions of the late peace
should not yet be duly executed; and that care was not taken to form
such alliances as might have rendered the peace not precarious. They
declared their resolution to inquire into these fatal miscarriages; to
trace out those measures whereon the pretender placed his hopes, and
bring the authors of them to condign punishment. These addresses were
not voted without opposition. In the house of lords, the dukes of
Buckingham and Shrewsbury, the earl of Anglesea, the archbishop of York,
and other peers both secular and ecclesiastical, observed, that their
address was injurious to the late queen's memory, and would serve only
to increase those unhappy divisions that distracted the kingdom. In the
lower house, sir William Wyndham, Mr. Bromley, Mr. Ship-pen, general
Ross, sir William Whitelock, and other members, took exceptions to
passages of the same nature in the address which the commons had
prepared. They were answered by Mr. Walpole, Mr. Pulteney, and Mr.
secretary Stanhope. These gentlemen took occasion to declare, that
notwithstanding the endeavours which had been used to prevent a
discovery of the late mismanagements, by conveying away several papers
from the secretary's office, yet the government had sufficient evidence
left to prove the late ministry the most corrupt that ever sat at the
helm; that those matters would soon be laid before the house, when it
would appear that a certain English general had acted in concert with,
if not received orders from, mareschal de Villars. Lord Bolingbroke, who
had hitherto appeared in public, as usual, with remarkable serenity, and
spoke in the house of lords with great freedom and confidence, thought
it was now high time to consult his personal safety. He accordingly
withdrew to the continent, leaving a letter which was afterwards printed
in his justification. In this paper, he declared he had received certain
and repeated informations, that a resolution was taken to pursue him to
the scaffold; that if there had been the least reason to hope for a fair
and open trial, after having been already prejudged, unheard, by the
two houses of parliament, he should not have declined the strictest
examination. He challenged the most inveterate of his enemies to produce
any one instance of criminal correspondence, or the least corruption in
any part of the administration in which he was concerned. He said, if
his zeal for the honour and dignity of his royal mistress, and the true
interest of his country, had any where transported him to let slip
a warm and unguarded expression, he hoped the most favourable
interpretation would be put upon it. He affirmed that he had served her
majesty faithfully and dutifully in that especially which she had most
at heart, relieving her people from a bloody and expensive war; and that
he had always been too much an Englishman to sacrifice the interest of
his country to any foreign ally whatsoever.
</p>
<center>
<p class="side">1715</p>
</center>
<p>
In the midst of all this violence against the late ministers, friends
were not wanting to espouse their cause in the face of opposition; and
even in some addresses to the king their conduct was justified.
Nay, some individuals had courage enough to attack the present
administration. When a motion was made in the house of commons to
consider the king's proclamation for calling a new parliament, sir
William Whitelock, member for the university of Oxford, boldly declared
it was unprecedented and unwarrantable. Being called upon to explain
himself, he made an apology. Nevertheless, sir William Wyndham rising up
said, the proclamation was not only unprecedented and unwarrantable,
but even of dangerous consequence to the very being of parliaments. When
challenged to justify his charge, he observed, that every member was
free to speak his thoughts. Some exclaimed, "The Tower! the Tower!"
A warm debate ensued; sir William being ordered to withdraw, was
accompanied by one hundred and twenty-nine members; and those who
remained in the house resolved, that he should be reprimanded by the
speaker. He was accordingly rebuked, for having presumed to reflect on
his majesty's proclamation, and having made an unwarrantable use of the
freedom of speech granted by his majesty. Sir William said he was not
conscious of having offered any indignity to his majesty, or of
having been guilty of a breach of privilege; that he acquiesced in the
determination of the house; but had no thanks to give to those gentlemen
who, under pretence of lenity, had subjected him to this censure.

<h2>
    COMMITTEE OF SECRECY.
</h2>
<p>
On the ninth day of April, general Stanhope delivered to the house of
commons fourteen volumes, consisting of all the papers relating to the
late negotiations of peace and commerce, as well as to the cessation
of arms; and moved that they might be referred to a select committee
of twenty persons, who should digest the substance of them under proper
heads, and report them, with their observations, to the house. One more
was added to the number of this secret committee, which was chosen
by ballot, and met that same evening. Mr. Eobert Wal-pole, original
chairman, being taken ill, was succeeded in that place by Mr. Stanhope.
The whole number was subdivided into three committees. To each a certain
number of books was allotted; and they carried on the inquiry with great
eagerness and expedition. Before this measure was taken, Dr.
Gilbert Burnet, bishop of Sarum, died of a pleuritic fever, in the
seventy-second year of his age. Immediately after the committee had
begun to act, the whig party lost one of their warmest champions, by the
death of the marquis of Wharton, a nobleman possessed of happy talents
for the cabinet, the senate, and the common scenes of life; talents
which a life of pleasure and libertinism did not prevent him from
employing with surprising vigour and application. The committee of the
lower house taking the civil list into consideration, examined several
papers relating to that revenue. The tories observed, that from the
seven hundred thousand pounds granted annually to king William, fifty
thousand pounds were allotted to the late queen, when princess of
Denmark; twenty thousand pounds to the duke of Gloucester; and twice
that sum, as a dowry, to James' queen; that nearly two hundred thousand
pounds had been yearly deducted from the revenues of the late queen's
civil list, and applied to other uses; notwithstanding which deduction,
she had honourably maintained her family, and supported the dignity of
the crown. In the course of the debate, some warm altercation passed
between lord Guernsey and one of the members, who affirmed that the
late ministry had used the whigs, and indeed the whole nation, in such
a manner, that nothing they should suffer could be deemed a hardship.
At length the house agreed that the sum of seven hundred thousand pounds
clear should be granted for the civil list during his majesty's life. A
motion being made for an address against pensions, it was opposed by Mr.
Walpole, and over-ruled by the majority. The lords passed the bill for
regulating the land forces, with some amendments.

<h2>
    SIR JOHN NORRIS SENT WITH A FLEET TO THE BALTIC.
</h2>
<p>
On the eighteenth day of May, sir John Norris sailed with a strong
squadron to the Baltic, in order to protect the commerce of the nation,
which had suffered from the king of Sweden, who caused all ships trading
to those parts to be seized and confiscated. That prince had rejected
the treaty of neutrality concerted by the allies for the security of
the empire; and considered the English and Dutch as his enemies. The
ministers of England and the states-general had presented memorials to
the regency of Sweden; but finding no redress, they resolved to protect
their trade by force of arms. After the Swedish general, Steenbock, and
his army were made prisoners, count Wellen concluded a treaty with the
administrator of Holstein-Gottorp, by which the towns of Stetin and
Wisma were sequestered into the hands of the king of Prussia; the
administrator engaged to secure them, and all the rest of Swedish
Pomerania, from the Poles and Muscovites; but as the governor of
Pomerania refused to comply with this treaty, those allies marched
into the province, subdued the island of Eugen, and obliged Stetin to
surrender. Then the governor consented to the sequestration, and paid to
the Poles and Muscovites four hundred thousand rix dollars, to indemnify
them for the expense of the siege. The king of Sweden returning from
Turkey, rejected the treaty of sequestration, and insisted upon Stetin's
being restored, without his repaying the money. As this monarch likewise
threatened to invade the electorate of Saxony, and chastise his false
friend; king George, for the security of his German dominions, concluded
a treaty with the king of Denmark, by which the duchies of Bremen and
Verden, which had been taken from the Swedes in his absence, were made
over to his Britannic majesty, on condition that he should immediately
declare war against Sweden. Accordingly he took possession of the
duchies in October, published a declaration of war against Charles in
his German dominions; and detached six thousand Hanoverians to join the
Danes and Prussians in Pomerania. These allies reduced the islands of
Rugen and Uledon, and attacked the towns of Wismar and Stralsund, from
which last place Charles was obliged to retire in a vessel to Schohen.
He assembled a body of troops with which he proposed to pass the Sound
upon the ice, and attack Copenhagen; but was disappointed by a sudden
thaw. Nevertheless he refused to return to Stockholm, which he had not
seen for sixteen years; but remained at Carlscroon, in order to hasten
his fleet for the relief of Wismar.

The spirit of discontent and disaffection seemed to gain ground every
day in England. Notwithstanding proclamations against riots, and orders
of the justices for maintaining the peace, repeated tumults were raised
by the malcontents in the cities of London and Westminster. Those who
celebrated the anniversary of the king's birth-day with the usual marks
of joy and festivity, were insulted by the populace; but next day, which
was the anniversary of the restoration, the whole city was lighted up
with bonfires and illuminations, and echoed with the sound of mirth
and tumultuous rejoicing. The people even obliged the life-guards, who
patroled through the streets, to join in the cry of "High-church and
Ormond!" and in Smithfield they burned the picture of king William.
Thirty persons were imprisoned for being concerned in these riots. One
Bournois, a schoolmaster, who affirmed that king George had no right to
the crown, was tried and scourged through the city, with such severity
that in a few days he expired in the utmost torture. A frivolous
incident served to increase the popular ferment. The shirts allowed to
the first regiment of guards, commanded by the duke of Marlborough, were
so coarse that the soldiers could hardly be persuaded to wear them. Some
were thrown into the garden of the king's palace, and into that which
belonged to the duke of Marlborough. A detachment, in marching through
the city, produced them to the view of the shop-keepers and passengers,
exclaiming, "These are the Hanover shirts." The court being informed
of this clamour, ordered those new shirts to be burned immediately;
but even this sacrifice, and an advertisement published by the duke
of Marlborough in his own vindication, did not acquit that general of
suspicion that he was concerned in this mean species of peculation. A
reward of fifty pounds was offered by the government to any person
that would discover one captain Wight, who, by an intercepted letter,
appeared to be disaffected to king George; and Mr. George Jefferies was
seized at Dublin with a packet directed to Dr. Jonathan Swift, dean of
St. Patrick's. Several treasonable papers being found in this packet,
were transmitted to England; Jefferies was obliged to give bail for his
appearance; and Swift thought proper to abscond.

<h2>
    REPORT OF THE SECRET COMMITTEE.
</h2>
<p>
The house of lords, to demonstrate their abhorrence of all who
should engage in conspiracies against their sovereign, rejected with
indignation a petition presented to them in behalf of Blackburne,
Casils, Barnarde, Meldrum, and Chambers, who had hitherto continued
prisoners, for having conspired against the life of king William. On
the ninth day of June, Mr. Walpole, as chairman of the secret committee,
declared to the house of commons that the report was ready; and in
the meantime moved, that a warrant might be issued by Mr. Speaker, for
apprehending several persons, particularly Mr. Matthew Prior and Mr.
Thomas Harley, who being in the house, were immediately taken into
custody. Then he recited the report, ranged under these different heads:
the clandestine negotiation with monsieur Mnager; the extraordinary
measures pursued to form the congress at Utrecht; the trifling of the
French plenipotentiaries, by the connivance of the British ministers;
the negotiation about the renunciation of the Spanish monarchy; the
fatal suspension of arms; the seizure of Ghent and Bruges, in order to
distress the allies and favour the French; the duke of Ormond's acting
in concert with the French general; the lord Bolingbroke's journey to
France to negotiate a separate peace; Mr. Prior's and the duke of
Shrewsbury's negotiation in France; the precipitate conclusion of the
peace at Utrecht. The report being read, sir Thomas Hanmer moved that
the consideration of it should be adjourned to a certain day; and that
in the meantime the report should be printed for the perusal of the
members: he was seconded by the tories: a debate ensued; and the motion
was rejected by a great majority.
</p>
<p>
This point being gained, Mr. Walpole impeached Henry lord viscount
Bolingbroke of high treason, and other high crimes and misdemeanors. Mr.
Hungerford declared his opinion, that nothing mentioned in the report,
in relation to lord Bolingbroke, amounted to high treason; and general
Eoss expressed the same sentiment. Then lord Coningsby standing up, "The
worthy chairman," said he, "has impeached the hand, but I impeach the
head: he has impeached the clerk, and I the justice; he has impeached
the scholar, and I the master. I impeach Eobert earl of Oxford and earl
Mortimer of high treason, and other high crimes and misdemeanors."
Mr. Auditor Harley, the earl's brother, spoke in vindication of that
minister. He affirmed he had done nothing but by the immediate command
of his sovereign; that the peace was a good peace, and approved as such
by two parliaments; and that the facts charged to him in the report
amounted only to misdemeanors; if the sanction of a parliament, which is
the representative and legislature of the nation, be not sufficient to
protect a minister from the vengeance of his enemies, he can have no
security. Mr. Atiditor Foley, the earl's brother-in-law, made a speech
to the same purpose; sir Joseph Jekyll, a staunch whig, and member of
the secret committee, expressed his doubt whether they had sufficient
matter or evidence to impeach the earl of high treason. Nevertheless the
house resolved to impeach him without a division. When he appeared in
the house of lords next day, he found himself deserted by his brother
peers as infectious; and retired with signs of confusion. Prior and
Harley having been examined by such of the committee as were justices of
the peace for Middlesex, Mr. Walpole informed the house that matters of
such importance appeared in Prior's examination, that he was directed
to move them for that member's being closely confined. Prior was
accordingly imprisoned, and cut off from all communication. On the
twenty-first day of June, Mr. Secretary Stanhope impeached James duke
of Ormond of high treason, and other high crimes and misdemeanors. Mr.
Archibald Hutchinson, one of the commissioners of trade, spoke in favour
of the duke. He expatiated on his noble birth and qualifications; he
enumerated the great services performed to the crown and nation by his
grace and his ancestors; he observed, that in the whole course of his
late conduct, he had only obeyed the queen's commands; and he affirmed
that all allegations against him could not in the rigour of the law be
construed into high treason. Mr. Hutchinson was seconded by general
Lumley, who urged that the duke of Ormond had on all occasions given
signal proofs of his affection for his country, as well as of personal
courage; and that he had generously expended the best part of his
estate, by living abroad in a most noble and splendid manner, for the
honour of his sovereign. Sir Joseph Jekyll said, if there was room
for mercy, he hoped it would be shown to that noble, generous, and
courageous peer, who had in a course of many years exerted those great
accomplishments for the good and honour of his country; that, as the
statute of Edward III., on which the charge of high treason against him
was to be grounded, had been mitigated by subsequent acts, the house
ought not, in his opinion, to take advantage of that act against the
duke, but only impeach him of high crimes and misdemeanors. General
Ross, sir William Wyndham, and the speakers of that party, did not
abandon the duke in this emergency; but all their arguments and
eloquence were lost upon the other faction, by which they were greatly
out-numbered The question being put, was carried for the impeachment of
the duke of Ormond, who perceiving every thing conducted by a furious
spirit of revenge, and that he could not expect the benefit of an
impartial trial, consulted his own safety by withdrawing himself from
the kingdom. On the twenty-second day of June, the earl of Strafford
was likewise impeached by Mr. Aislaby, for having advised the fatal
suspension of arms, and the seizing of Ghent and Bruges; as well as
for having treated the most serene house of Hanover with insolence and
contempt. He was also defended by his friends, but overpowered by his
enemies.

<h2>
    EARL OF OXFORD SENT TO THE TOWER.
</h2>
<p>
When the articles against the earl of Oxford were read in the house, a
warm debate arose upon the eleventh, by which he was charged with having
advised the French king in what manner Tournay might be gained from the
states-general. The question being put, whether this article amounted to
high-treason; sir Robert Raymond, formerly solicitor-general, maintained
the negative, and was supported not only by sir William Wyndham and the
tories, but also by sir Joseph Jekyll. This honest patriot said it was
ever his principle to do justice to every body, from the highest to
the lowest; and that it was the duty of an honest man never to act by a
spirit of party; that he hoped he might pretend to have some knowledge
of the laws of the kingdom; and would not scruple to declare, that in
his judgment the charge in question did not amount to high-treason. Mr.
Walpole answered with great warmth, that there were several persons
both in and out of the committee, who did not in the least yield to
that member in point of honesty, and who were superior to him in the
knowledge of the laws, yet were satisfied that the charge specified in
the eleventh article amounted to high-treason. This point being decided
against the earl, and the other articles approved by the house, lord
Conningsby, attended by the whig members, impeached the earl of Oxford
at the bar of the house of lords, demanding at the same time that he
might be sequestered from parliament, and committed to safe custody.
A motion was made, that the consideration of the articles might be
adjourned. After a short debate the articles were read; then the
tory lords moved that the judges might be consulted. The motion being
rejected, another was made, that the earl should be committed to safe
custody. This occasioned another debate, in which he himself spoke to
the following purpose: that the whole charge might be reduced to the
negotiations and conclusions of the peace; that the nation wanted a
peace, he said, nobody would deny; that the conditions of the peace
were as good as could be expected, considering the backwardness and
reluctancy which some of the allies showed to come into the queen's
measures; that the peace was approved by two successive parliaments;
that he had no share in the affair of Tournay, which was wholly
transacted by that unfortunate nobleman who has thought fit to
step aside; that for his own part, he always acted by the immediate
directions and commands of the late queen, without offending against any
known law; and, being justified by his own conscience, was unconcerned
for the life of an insignificant old man; that, if ministers of state,
acting by the immediate commands of their sovereign, are afterwards to
be made accountable for their proceedings, it might one day or other be
the case with all the members of that august assembly; that he did not
doubt their lordships, out of regard to themselves, would give him an
equitable hearing; and that in the prosecution of the inquiry it would
appear he had merited not only the indulgence, but even the favour of
his government. "My lords," said he, "I am now to take my leave of your
lordships, and of this honourable house, perhaps for ever; I shall lay
down my life with pleasure in a cause favoured by my late dear royal
mistress. When I consider that I am to be judged by the justice,
honour, and virtue of my peers, I shall acquiesce, and retire with great
content; and, my lords, God's will be done." The duke of Shrewsbury
having acquainted the house that the earl was very much indisposed with
the gravel, he was suffered to remain at his own house in custody of the
black-rod; in his way thither he was attended by a great multitude of
people crying, "High-church, Ormond and Oxford for ever!" Next day he
was brought to the bar; where he received a copy of the articles, and
was allowed a month to prepare his answer. Though Dr. Mead declared that
if the earl should be sent to the Tower his life would be in danger, it
was carried, on a division, that he should be conveyed thither on the
sixteenth day of July. During the debate, the earl of Anglesea observed,
that these impeachments were disagreeable to the nation, and that it was
to be feared such violent measures would make the sceptre shake in the
king's hands. This expression kindled the whole house into a flame. Some
members cried, "To the Tower!" some, "To order!" The earl of Sunderland
declared, that if these words had been spoken in another place, he
would have called the person that had spoken them to an account; in the
meantime he moved that the noble lord should explain himself. Anglesea,
dreading the resentment of the house, was glad to make an apology;
which was accepted. The earl of Oxford was attended to the Tower by a
prodigious concourse of people, who did not scruple to exclaim against
his persecutors. Tumults were raised in Staffordshire, and other parts
of the kingdom, against the whig party, which had depressed the friends
of the church and embroiled the nation. The house of commons presented
an address to the king, desiring that the laws might be vigorously
executed against the rioters. They prepared the proclamation-act,
decreeing, that if any persons to the number of twelve, unlawfully
assembled, should continue together one hour after having been required
to disperse by a justice of peace or other officer, and heard the
proclamation against riots read in public, they should be deemed guilty
of felony without benefit of clergy.

<h2>
    THE KING DECLARES TO BOTH HOUSES THAT A REBELLION IS BEGUN.
</h2>
<p>
When the king went to the house of peers on the twentieth day of July,
to give the royal assent to this and some other bills, he told both
houses that a rebellion was actually begun at home; and that the nation
was threatened with an invasion from abroad. He therefore expected that
the commons would not leave the kingdom in a defenceless condition, but
enable him to take such measures as should be necessary for the public
safety. Addresses in the usual style were immediately presented by
the parliament, the convocation, the common-council and lieutenancy of
London, and the two universities; but that of Oxford was received in the
most contemptuous manner; and the deputies were charged with disloyalty,
on account of a fray which had happened between some recruiting officers
and the scholars of the university. The addresses from the kirk of
Scotland, and the dissenting ministers of London and Westminster, met
with a much more gracious reception. The parliament forthwith passed a
bill, empowering the king to secure suspected persons, and to suspend
the <i>habeas-corpus</i> act in that time of danger. A clause was added to a
money-bill, offering the reward of one hundred thousand pounds to such
as should seize the pretender dead or alive. Sir George Byng was sent to
take the command of the fleet. General Earle repaired to his government
of Portsmouth; the guards were encamped in Hyde-park; lord Irwin was
appointed governor of Hull, in the room of brigadier Sutton, who,
together with lord Windsor, the generals Ross, Webb, and Stuart, were
dismissed from the service. Orders were given for raising thirteen
regiments of dragoons, and eight of infantry; and the trained bands
were kept in readiness to suppress tumults. In the midst of these
transactions, the commons added six articles to those exhibited against
the earl of Oxford. Lord Bolingbroke was impeached at the bar of the
house of lords by Mr. Walpole. Bills being brought in to summon him and
the duke of Ormond to surrender themselves by the tenth of September,
or, in default thereof, to attaint them of high treason, they passed
both houses and received the royal assent. On the last day of August,
the commons agreed to the articles against the earl of Strafford, which
being presented to the house of lords, the earl made a speech in his
own vindication. He complained that his papers had been seized in an
unprecedented manner. He said, if he had in his letters or discourse
dropped any unguarded expressions against some foreign ministers, while
he had the honour to represent the crown of Great Britain, he hoped they
would not be accounted criminal by a British house of peers; he desired
he might be allowed a competent time to answer the articles brought
against him, and have duplicates of all the papers which had either
been laid before the committee of secrecy, or remained in the hands of
government, to be used occasionally in his justification. This request
was vehemently opposed by the leaders of the other party, until the
earl of Hay represented that, in all civilized nations, all courts of
judicature, except the inquisition, allowed the persons arraigned all
that was necessary for their justification; and that the house of peers
of Great Britain ought not, in this case, to do any thing contrary to
that honour and equity for which they were so justly renowned throughout
all Europe. This observation made an impression on the house, which
resolved that the earl should be indulged with copies of such papers as
he might have occasion to use in his defence.

<h2>
    DUKE OF ORMOND AND LORD BOLINGBROKE ATTAINTED.
</h2>
<p>
On the third day of September, Oxford's answer was delivered to the
house of lords, who transmitted it to the commons. Mr. Walpole, having
heard it read, said it contained little more than a repetition of what
had been suggested in some pamphlets and papers which had been published
in vindication of the late ministry; that it was a false and malicious
libel, laying upon his royal mistress the blame of all the pernicious
measures he had led her into, against her own honour, and the good of
his country; that it was likewise a libel on the proceedings of the
commons, since he endeavoured to clear those persons who had already
confessed their guilt by flight. After some debate, the house resolved,
that the answer of Robert earl of Oxford should be referred to the
committee appointed to draw up articles of impeachment, and prepare
evidence against the impeached lords; and that the committee should
prepare a replication to the answer. This was accordingly prepared and
sent up to the lords. Then the committee reported, that Mr. Prior had
grossly prevaricated on his examination, and behaved with great contempt
of their authority. The duke of Ormond and lord viscount Bolingbroke
having omitted to surrender themselves within the limited time, the
house of lords ordered the earl-marshal to raze out of the list of
peers their names and armorial bearings. Inventories were taken of their
personal estates; and the duke's achievements, as knight of the garter,
were taken down from St. George's chapel at Windsor. A man of candour
cannot, without an emotion of grief and indignation, reflect upon the
ruin of the noble family of Ormond, in the person of a brave, generous,
and humane nobleman, to whom no crime was imputed but that of having
obeyed the commands of his sovereign. About this period the royal assent
was given to an act for encouraging loyalty in Scotland. By this law the
tenant who continued peaceable while his lord took arms in favour of the
pretender, was invested with the property of the lands he rented; on the
other hand, it was decreed that the lands possessed by any person guilty
of high treason should revert to the superior of whom they were held,
and be consolidated with the superiority; and that all entails and
settlements of estates, since the first day of August, in favour of
children, with a fraudulent intent to avoid the punishment of the law
due to the offence of high treason, should be null and void. It likewise
contained a clause for summoning suspected persons to find bail for
their good behaviour, on pain of being denounced rebels. By virtue of
this clause all the heads of the jacobite clans, and other suspected
persons, were summoned to Edinburgh; and those who did not appear were
declared rebels.

<div style="height: 4em;"><br><br><br><br></div>

<h2>
    INTRIGUES OF THE JACOBITES.
</h2>
<p>
By this time the rebellion was actually begun in Scotland. The
dissensions occasioned in that country by the union had never been
wholly appeased. Ever since the queen's death, addresses were prepared
in different parts of Scotland against the union, which was deemed a
national grievance; and the Jacobites did not fail to encourage this
aversion. Though the hopes of dissolving that treaty were baffled by the
industry and other arts of the revolutioners, who secured a majority of
whigs in parliament, they did not lay aside their designs of attempting
something of consequence in favour of the pretender; but maintained a
correspondence with the malcontents of England, a great number of whom
were driven by apprehension, hard usage, and resentment, into a system
of politics which otherwise they would not have espoused. The tories
finding themselves totally excluded from any share in the government and
legislature, and exposed to the insolence and fury of a faction which
they despised, began to wish in earnest for a revolution. Some of them
held private consultations, and communicated with the Jacobites, who
conveyed their sentiments to the chevalier de St. George, with such
exaggerations as were dictated by their own eagerness and extravagance.
They assured the pretender that the nation was wholly disaffected to the
new government; and indeed the clamours, tumults, and conversation of
the people in general countenanced this assertion. They promised to take
arms, without further delay, in his favour; and engaged that the tories
should join them at his first landing in Great Britain. They therefore
besought him to come over with all possible expedition, declaring that
his appearance would produce an immediate revolution. The chevalier
resolved to take the advantage of this favourable disposition. He had
recourse to the French king, who had always been the refuge of his
family. Louis favoured him in secret; and, notwithstanding his late
engagements with England, cherished the ambition of raising him to the
throne of Great Britain. He supplied him privately with sums of money to
prepare a small armament in the port of Havre, which was equipped in
the name of Depine d'Anicaut; and, without all doubt, his design was to
assist him more effectually in proportion as the English should manifest
their attachment to the house of Stuart. The duke of Ormond and lord
Bolingbroke, who had retired to France, finding themselves condemned
unheard, and attainted, engaged in the service of the chevalier, and
corresponded with the tories of England.

<h2>
    DEATH OF LOUIS XIV.
</h2>
<p>
All these intrigues and machinations were discovered and communicated
to the court of London by the earl of Stair, who then resided as English
ambassador at Paris. He was a nobleman of unquestioned honour and
integrity, generous, humane, discerning, and resolute. He had signalized
himself by his valour, intrepidity, and other military talents, during
the war in the Netherlands; and he now acted in another sphere with
uncommon vigour, vigilance, and address. He detected the chevalier's
scheme while it was yet in embryo, and gave such early notice of it
as enabled the king of Great Britain to take effectual measures for
defeating the design. All the pretender's interest in France expired
with Louis XIV., that ostentatious tyrant, who had for above half a
century sacrificed the repose of Christendom to his insatiate vanity and
ambition. At his death, which happened on the first day of September,
the regency of the kingdom devolved to the duke of Orleans, who adopted
a new system of politics, and had already entered into engagements with
the king of Great Britain. Instead of assisting the pretender, he amused
his agents with mysterious and equivocal expressions, calculated to
frustrate the design of the expedition. Nevertheless, the more violent
part of the Jacobites in Great Britain believed he was at bottom a
friend to their cause, and depended upon him for succour. They even
extorted from him a sum of money by dint of importunities, and some
arms; but the vessel was shipwrecked, and the cargo lost upon the coast
of Scotland.

<h2>
    THE EARL OF MAR SETS UP THE PRETENDER'S STANDARD.
</h2>
<p>
The partisans of the pretender had proceeded too far to retreat with
safety, and therefore resolved to try their fortune in the field. The
earl of Mar repaired to the Highlands, where he held consultations with
the marquasses of Huntley and Tullibardine, the earls Marischal and
Southesk, the generals Hamilton and Gordon, with the chiefs of the
Jacobite clans. Then he assembled three hundred of his own vassals,
proclaimed the pretender at Castletown, and set up his standard at
Brae-Mar, on the sixth day of September. By this time the earls of Home,
Winton, and Kinnoul, lord Deskford, and Lockhart of Carnwath, with
other persons suspected of disaffection to the present government,
were committed prisoners to the castle of Edinburgh; and major-general
Whetham marched with the regular troops which were in that kingdom to
secure the bridge at Stirling. Before these precautions were taken, two
vessels had arrived at Arbroath from Havre, with arms, ammunition, and a
great number of officers, who assured the earl of Mar that the pretender
would soon be with them in person. The death of Louis the XIV. struck a
general damp upon their spirits; but they laid their account with being
joined by a powerful body in England. The earl of Mar, by letters and
messages, pressed the chevalier to come over without further delay.
He, in the meantime, assumed the title of lieutenant-general of the
pretender's forces, and published a declaration, exhorting the people
to take arms for their lawful sovereign. This was followed by a shrewd
manifesto, explaining the national grievances, and assuring the people
of redress. Some of his partisans attempted to surprise the castle of
Edinburgh; but were prevented by the vigilance and activity of colonel
Stuart, lieutenant-governor of that fortress. The duke of Argyle set out
for Scotland, as commander-in-chief of the forces in North Britain: the
earl of Sutherland set sail in the Queen-borough ship-of-war for
the North, where he proposed to raise his vassals for the service of
government; and many other Scottish peers returned to their own country
in order to signalize their loyalty to king George.
</p>
<p>
In England the practices of the Jacobites did not escape the notice of
the ministry. Lieutenant-colonel Paul was imprisoned in the gate-house
for enlisting men in the service of the pretender. The titular duke of
Powis was committed to the Tower; lords Lansdown-e and Duplin were taken
into custody; and a warrant was issued for apprehending the earl of
Jersey. The king desired the consent of the lower house to seize and
detain sir William Wyndham, sir John Packington, Mr. Edward Harvey of
Combe, Mr. Thos. Forster, Mr. John Anstis, and Mr. Corbet Kynaston, who
were members of the house, and suspected of favouring the invasion. The
commons unanimously agreed to the proposal, and presented an address
signifying their approbation. Harvey and Anstis were immediately
secured. Forster, with the assistance of some popish lords, assembled a
body of men in Northumberland' sir John Packington being examined before
the council, was dismissed for want of evidence: Mr. Kynaston absconded;
sir William Wyndham was seized at his own house in Somersetshire, by
colonel Huske and a messenger, who secured his papers: he found means,
however, to escape from them; but afterwards surrendered himself: and,
having been examined at the council-board, was committed to the Tower.
His father-in-law, the duke of Somerset, offered to become bound for
his appearance; and being rejected as bail, expressed his resentment
so warmly that the king thought proper to remove him from the office of
master of the horse. On the twenty-first day of September, the king went
to the house of lords and passed the bills that were ready for the royal
assent. Then the chancellor read his majesty's speech, expressing his
acknowledgment and satisfaction, in consequence of the uncommon marks
of their affection he had received; and the parliament adjourned to the
sixth day of October.
</p>
<p>
The friends of the house of Stuart were very numerous in the western
counties, and began to make preparations for an insurrection. They
had concealed some arms and artillery at Bath, and formed a design
to surprise Bristol; but they were betrayed and discovered by the
emissaries of the government, which baffled all their schemes, and
apprehended every person of consequence suspected of attachment to that
cause. The university of Oxford felt the rod of power on that occasion.
Major-general Pepper, with a strong detachment of dragoons, took
possession of the city at day-break, declaring he would use military
execution on all students who should presume to appear without the
limits of their respective colleges. He seized tenor eleven persons,
among whom was one Lloyd, a coffee-man; and made prize of some horses
and furniture belonging to colonel Owen and other gentlemen. With this
booty he retreated to Abingdon; and Handasyde's regiment of foot was
afterwards quartered in Oxford to overawe the university. The ministry
found it more difficult to suppress the insurgents in the northern
counties. In the month of October the earl of Derwentwater and Mr.
Forster took the field with a body of horse, and being joined by some
gentlemen from the borders of Scotland, proclaimed the pretender in
Warkworth, Morpeth, and Alnwick. The first design was to seize the town
of Newcastle, in which they had many friends; but they found the gates
shut upon them, and retired to Hexham; while general Carpenter having
assembled a body of dragoons, resolved to march from Newcastle and
attack them before they should be reinforced. The rebels retiring
northward to Woller, were joined by two hundred Scottish horse under the
lord viscount Kenmuir, and the earls of Carnwath and Winton, who had set
up the pretender's standard at Moffat, and proclaimed him in different
parts of Scotland. The rebels thus reinforced advanced to Kelso, having
received advice that they would be joined by Mackintosh, who had crossed
the Forth with a body of Highlanders.

<h2>
    MACKINTOSH JOINS THE ENGLISH INSURGENTS.
</h2>
<p>
By this time the earl of Mar was at the head of ten thousand men
well armed. He had secured the pass of the Tay at Perth, where his
head-quarters were established, and made himself master of the whole
fruitful province of Fife, and all the sea-coast on that side of the
Frith of Edinburgh. He selected two thousand five hundred men, commanded
by brigadier Mackintosh, to make a descent upon the Lothian side, and
join the Jacobites in that county, or such as should take arms on
the borders of England. Boats were assembled for this purpose; and
notwithstanding all the precautions that could be taken by the king's
ships in the Frith to prevent the design, about fifteen hundred chosen
men made good their passage in the night, and landed on the coast of
Lothian, having crossed an arm of the sea about sixteen miles broad, in
open boats that passed through the midst of the king's cruisers. Nothing
could be better concerted, or executed with more conduct and courage,
than was this hazardous enterprise. They amused the king's ships with
marches and counter-marches along the coast, in such a manner that they
could not possibly know where they intended to embark. The earl of Mar,
in the meantime, marched from Perth to Dumblane as if he had intended
to cross the Forth at Stirling bridge; but his real design was to divert
the duke of Argyle from attacking his detachment which had landed in
Lothian. So far the scheme succeeded. The duke, who had assembled some
troops in Lothian, returned to Stirling with the utmost expedition,
after having secured Edinburgh and obliged Mackintosh to abandon his
design on that city. This partisan had actually taken possession of
Leith, from whence he retired to Seaton-house, near Prestonpans, which
he fortified in such a manner that he could not be forced without
artillery. Here he remained until he received an order across the Frith
from the earl of Mar to join lord Kenmuir and the English at Kelso,
for which place he immediately began his march, and reached it on
the twenty-second day of October, though a good number of his men had
deserted on the route.
</p>
<p>
The lord Kenmuir, with the earls of Winton, Nithsdale, and Carnwath,
the earl of Derwentwater, and Mr. Forster with the English insurgents,
arriving at the same time, a council of war was immediately called.
Winton proposed that they should march immediately into the western
parts of Scotland and join general Gordon, who commanded a strong body
of Highlanders in Argyleshire. The English insisted upon crossing the
Tweed and attacking general Carpenter, whose troops did not exceed nine
hundred dragoons. Neither scheme was executed. They took the route
to Jedburgh, where they resolved to leave Carpenter on one side and
penetrate into England by the western border. The Highlanders declared
they would not quit their own country, but were ready to execute the
scheme proposed by the earl of Winton. Means however were found to
prevail upon one half of them to advance, while the rest returned to the
Highlands. At Brampton, Forster opened his commission of general, which
had been sent to him by the earl of Mar, and proclaimed the pretender.
They continued their march to Penrith, where the sheriff, assisted
by lord Lonsdale and the bishop of Carlisle, had assembled the whole
posse-comitatus of Cumberland, amounting to twelve thousand men, who
dispersed with the utmost precipitation at the approach of the rebels.
From Penrith, Forster proceeded by way of Kendal and Lancaster to
Preston, from whence Stanhope's regiment of dragoons and another of
militia immediately retired, so that he took possession of the place
without resistance. General Willis marched against the enemy with six
regiments of horse and dragoons, and one battalion of foot commanded
by colonel Preston. They had advanced to the bridge of Ribble before
Forster received intelligence of their approach. He forthwith began to
raise barricadoes, and put the place in a posture of defence. On the
twelfth day of November the town was briskly attacked in two different
places; but the king's troops met with a very warm reception, and were
repulsed with considerable loss. Next day general Carpenter arrived
with a reinforcement of three regiments of dragoons, and the rebels were
invested on all sides. The Highlanders declared they would make a sally
sword in hand, and either cut their way through the king's troops or
perish in the attempt, but they were over-ruled. Forster sent colonel
Oxburgh with a trumpet to general Willis, to propose a capitulation. He
was given to understand that the general would not treat with rebels;
but in case of their surrendering at discretion, he would prevent his
soldiers from putting them to the sword until he should receive further
orders. He granted them time to consider till next morning, upon
their delivering the earl of Derwentwater and Mackintosh as hostages.
When Forster submitted, this Highlander declared he could not promise
the Scots would surrender in that manner. The general desired him to
return to his people, and he would forthwith attack the town, in which
case every man of them should be cut to pieces. The Scottish noblemen
did not choose to run the risk, and persuaded the Highlanders to accept
the terms that were offered. They accordingly laid down their arms,
and were put under a strong guard. All the noblemen and leaders were
secured. Major Nairn, captain Lockhart, captain Shaftoe, and ensign
Erskine, were tried by a court-martial as deserters, and executed. Lord
Charles Murray, son of the duke of Athol, was likewise condemned for the
same crime, but reprieved. The common men were imprisoned at Chester and
Liverpool, the noblemen and considerable officers were sent to London,
conveyed through the streets pinioned like malefactors, and committed
to the Tower and to Newgate.

<h2>
    BATTLE AT DUMBLANE.
</h2>
<p>
The day on which the rebels surrendered at Preston was remarkable for
the battle of Dumblane, fought between the duke of Argyle and the
earl of Mar, who commanded the pretender's forces. This nobleman had
retreated to his camp at Perth, when he understood the duke was returned
from Lothian to Stirling. But being now joined by the northern clans
under the earl of Sea-forth, and those of the west commanded by general
Gordon, who had signalized himself in the service of the czar of
Muscovy, he resolved to pass the Forth in order to join his southern
friends, that they might march together into England. With this view he
advanced to Auchterarder, where he reviewed his army, and rested on the
eleventh day of November. The duke of Argyle, apprised of his intention,
and being joined by some regiments of dragoons from Ireland, determined
to give him battle in the neighbourhood of Dumblane. On the twelfth day
of the month, Argyle passed the Forth at Stirling, and encamped with his
left at the village of Dumblane, and his right towards Sheriffmuir. The
earl of Mar advanced within two miles of his camp, and remained till
day-break in order of battle; his army consisted of nine thousand
effective men, cavalry as well as infantry. In the morning the duke,
understanding they were in motion, drew up his forces, which did not
exceed three thousand five hundred men, on the heights to the north-east
of Dumblane; but he was outflanked both on the right and left. The
clans that formed part of the centre and right wing of the enemy, with
Glengary and Clanronald at their head, charged the left of the king's
army sword in hand, with such impetuosity that in seven minutes both
horse and foot were totally routed with great slaughter; and general
Whetham, who commanded them, fled at full gallop to Stirling, where he
declared that the royal army was totally defeated. In the meantime the
duke of Argyle, who commanded in person on the right, attacked the left
of the enemy, at the head of Stair's and Evan's dragoons, and drove them
two miles before him, as far as the water of Allan; yet in that space
they wheeled about and attempted to rally ten times; so that he was
obliged to press them hard that they might not recover from their
confusion. Brigadier Wightman followed in order to sustain him with
three battalions of infantry; while the victorious right wing of the
rebels having pursued Whetham a considerable way, returned to the field
and formed in the rear of Wightman to the amount of five thousand men.
The duke of Argyle returning from the pursuit, joined Wightman, who had
faced about and taken possession of some enclosures and mud wails in
expectation of being attacked. In this posture both armies fronted each
other till the evening, when the duke drew off towards Dumblane, and the
rebels retired to Ardoch, without mutual molestation. Next day the duke
marching back to the field of battle, carried off the wounded, with
four pieces of cannon left by the army, and retreated to Stirling. Few
prisoners were taken on either side: the number of the slain might be
about five hundred of each army, and both generals claimed the
victory. This battle was not so fatal to the Highlanders as the loss
of Inverness, from which sir John Mackenzie was driven by Simon Fraser,
lord Lovat, who, contrary to the principles he hitherto professed,
secured this important post for the government; by which means a free
communication was opened with the north of Scotland, where the earl of
Sutherland had raised a considerable body of vassals. The marquis of
Huntley and the earl of Seaforth were obliged to quit the rebel army, in
order to defend their own territories; and in a little time submitted
to king George: a good number of the Frasers declared with their chief
against the pretender: the marquis of Tullibardine withdrew from the
army to cover his own country; and the clans, seeing no likelihood of
another action, began to disperse according to custom.

<h2>
    THE PRETENDER ARRIVES IN SCOTLAND.
</h2>
<p>
The government was now in a condition to send strong reinforcements to
Scotland. Six thousand men that were claimed of the states-general,
by virtue of the treaty, landed in England, and began their march for
Edinburgh: general Cadogan set out for the same place, together with
brigadier Petit, and six other engineers; and a train of artillery was
shipped at the Tower for that country, the duke of Argyle resolving to
drive the earl of Mar out of Perth, to which town he retired with the
remains of his forces. The pretender having been amused with the hope
of seeing the whole kingdom of England rise up as one man in his behalf;
and the duke of Ormond having made a fruitless voyage to the western
coast, to try the disposition of the people, he was now convinced of
the vanity of his expectation in that quarter; and, as he knew not what
other course to take, he resolved to hazard his person among his friends
in Scotland, at a time when his affairs in that kingdom were absolutely
desperate. From Bretagne he posted through part of France in disguise,
and embarking in a small vessel at Dunkirk, hired for that purpose,
arrived on the twenty-second day of December at Peterhead with six
gentlemen in his retinue, one of whom was the marquis of Tynemouth,
son to the duke of Berwick. He passed through Aberdeen incognito, to
Fetterosse, where he was met by the earls of Mar and Marischal, and
about thirty noblemen and gentlemen of the first quality. Here he was
solemnly proclaimed: his declaration, dated at Com-mercy, was printed
and circulated through all the parts in that neighbourhood; and he
received addresses from the episcopal clergy, and the laity of that
communion in the diocese of Aberdeen. On the fifth day of January he
made his public entry into Dundee; and on the seventh arrived at Scone,
where he seemed determined to stay until the ceremony of his coronation
should be performed. From thence he made an excursion to Perth, where he
reviewed his forces. Then he formed a regular council; and published
six proclamations: one for a general thanksgiving on account of his
safe arrival; another enjoining the ministers to pray for him in the
churches; a third establishing the currency of foreign coins; a fourth
summoning the meeting of the convention of estates; a fifth ordering
all sensible men to repair to his standard; and a sixth, fixing the
twenty-third day of January for his coronation. He made a pathetic
speech in a grand council, at which all the chiefs of his party
assisted. They determined, however, to abandon the enterprise, as the
king's army was reinforced by the Dutch auxiliaries, and they themselves
were not only reduced to a small number, but likewise destitute of
money, arms, ammunition, forage, and provision; for the duke of Argyle
had taken possession of Burntisland, and transported a detachment to
Fife, so as to cut off Mar's communication with that fertile country.
</p>
<p>
Notwithstanding the severity of the weather, and a prodigious fall
of snow which rendered the roads almost impassable, the duke, on the
twenty-ninth of January began his march for Dumblane, and next day
reached Tullibardine, where he received intelligence that the pretender
and his forces had, on the preceding day, retired towards Dundee.
He forthwith took possession of Perth; and then began his march to
Aberbrothick, in pursuit of the enemy. The chevalier de St. George being
thus hotly pursued, was prevailed upon to embark on board a small French
ship that lay in the harbour of Montrose. He was accompanied by the
earls of Mar and Melfort, the lord Drummond, lieutenant-general Bulkley,
and other persons of distinction, to the number of seventeen. In order
to avoid the English cruisers, they stretched over to Norway, and
coasting along the German and Dutch shores, arrived in five days
at Grave-line. General Gordon, whom the pretender had left
commander-in-chief of the forces, assisted by the earl Marischal,
proceeded with them to Aberdeen, where he secured three vessels to sail
northward, and take on board the persons who intended to make their
escape to the continent. Then they continued their march through
Strathspey and Strathdown, to the hills of Badenoch, where the
common people were quietly dismissed. This retreat was made with such
expedition, that the duke of Argyle, with all his activity, could never
overtake their rear-guard, which consisted of a thousand horse commanded
by the earl Marischal. Such was the issue of a rebellion that proved
fatal to many noble families; a rebellion which in all probability would
never have happened, had not the violent measures of a whig ministry
kindled such a flame of discontent in the nation, as encouraged the
partisans of the pretender to hazard a revolt.

<h2>
    PROCEEDINGS OF THE IRISH PARLIAMENT.
</h2>
<p>
The parliament of Ireland, which met at Dublin on the twelfth day of
November, seemed even more zealous, if possible, than that of England,
for the present administration. They passed bills for recognizing the
king's title; for the security of his person and government; for setting
a price on the pretender's head; and for attainting the duke of
Ormond. They granted the supplies without opposition. All those who had
addressed the late queen in favour of sir Constantine Phipps, then lord
chancellor of Ireland, were now brought upon their knees, and censured
as guilty of a breach of privilege. They desired the lords-justices
would issue a proclamation against the popish inhabitants of Limerick
and Gal-way, who, presuming upon the capitulation signed by king
William, claimed an exemption from the penalties imposed upon other
papists. They engaged in an association against the pretender, and all
his abettors. They voted the earl of Anglesea an enemy to the king and
kingdom, because he advised the queen to break the army, and prorogue
the late parliament; and they addressed the king to remove him from his
council and service. The lords-justices granted orders for apprehending
the earls of Antrim and Westmeath, the lords Natterville, Cahir, and
Dillon, as persons suspected of disaffection to the government. Then
they adjourned the two houses.

<h2>
    THE REBEL LORDS ARE IMPEACHED.
</h2>
<p>
The king in his speech to the English parliament, which met on the ninth
of January, told them he had reason to believe the pretender was
landed in Scotland; he congratulated them on the success of his arms
in suppressing the rebellion; on the conclusion of the barrier-treaty
between the emperor and the states-general, under his guarantee; on a
convention with Spain that would deliver the trade of England to
that kingdom, from the new impositions and hardships to which it was
subjected in consequence of the late treaties. He likewise gave them to
understand, that a treaty for renewing all former alliances between the
crown of Great Britain and the states-general was almost concluded;
and he assured the commons he would freely give up all the estates that
should become forfeited to the crown by this rebellion, to be applied
towards defraying the extraordinary expense incurred on this occasion.
The commons, in their address of thanks, declared that they would
prosecute, in the most vigorous and impartial manner, the authors of
those destructive councils which had drawn down such miseries upon the
nation. Their resolutions were speedy, and exactly conformable to this
declaration. They expelled Mr. Forster from the house. They forthwith
impeached the earls of Derwentwater, Nithsdale, Carnwath, and Winton;
lords Widdrington, Kenmuir, and Nairn. These noblemen being brought to
the bar of the house of lords, heard the articles of impeachment read
on the tenth day of January, and were ordered to put in their answers on
the sixteenth. The impeachments being lodged, the lower house ordered
a bill to be brought in for continuing the suspension of the
<i>habeas-corpus</i> act; then they prepared another to attaint the marquis
of Tullibardine, the earls of Mar and Linlithgow, and lord John
Drummond. On the twenty-first day of January, the king gave the royal
assent to the bill for continuing the suspension of the <i>habeas-corpus</i>
act. He told the parliament that the pretender was actually in Scotland
heading the rebellion, and assuming the style and title of king of these
realms; he demanded of the commons such supply as might discourage any
foreign power from assisting the rebels. On Thursday the nineteenth
day of January, all the impeached lords pleaded guilty to the articles
exhibited against them, except the earl of Winton, who petitioned for a
longer time on various pretences. The rest received sentence of death
on the ninth day of February, in the court erected in Westminster-hall,
where the lord-chancellor Cowper presided as lord high-steward on that
occasion. The countess of Nithsdale and lady Nairn threw themselves at
the king's feet, as he passed through the apartments of the palace,
and implored his mercy in behalf of their husbands; but their tears and
entreaties produced no effect. The council resolved that the sentence
should be executed, and orders were given for that purpose to the
lieutenant of the Tower, and the sheriffs of London and Middlesex.

<h2>
    EARL OF DEEWENTWATER AND LORD KENMUIR ARE BEHEADED.
</h2>
<p>
The countess of Derwentwater, with her sister, accompanied by the
duchesses of Cleveland and Bolton, and several other ladies of the first
distinction, was introduced by the dukes of Richmond and St. Alban's
into the king's bed-chamber, where she invoked his majesty's clemency
for her unfortunate consort. She afterwards repaired to the lobby of the
house of peers, attended by the ladies of the other condemned lords, and
above twenty others of the same quality, and begged the intercession
of the house; but no regard was paid to their petition. Next day they
petitioned both houses of parliament. The commons rejected their suit.
In the upper house, the duke of Richmond delivered a petition from the
earl of Derwentwater, to whom he was nearly related, at the same time
declaring that he himself should oppose his solicitation. The earl of
Derby expressed some compassion for the numerous family of lord Nairn.
Petitions from the rest were presented by other lords, moved with pity
and humanity. Lord Town-shend and others vehemently opposed their being
read. The earl of Nottingham thought this indulgence might be granted;
the house assented to his opinion, and agreed to an address, praying
his majesty would reprieve such of the condemned lords as should seem to
deserve his mercy. To this petition the king answered, that on this and
all other occasions, he would do what he thought most consistent with
the dignity of his crown and the safety of his people. The earl of
Nottingham, president of the council, his brother the earl of Aylesbury,
chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, his son lord Finch, one of
the lords of the treasury, his kinsman lord Guernsey, master of the
jewel-office, were altogether dismissed from his majesty's service.
Orders were despatched for executing the earls of Derwentwater and
Nithsdale, and the viscount of Kennruir, immediately; the others were
respited to the seventh day of March. Nithsdale made his escape in
woman's apparel, furnished and conveyed to him by his own mother. On the
twenty-fourth day of February, Derwentwater and Kenmuir were beheaded
on Tower-hill. The former was an amiable youth, brave, open, generous,
hospitable, and humane. His fate drew tears from the spectators, and was
a great misfortune to the country in which he lived. He gave bread
to multitudes of people whom he employed on his estate; the poor, the
widow, and the orphan rejoiced in his bounty. Kenmuir was a virtuous
nobleman, calm, sensible, resolute, and resigned. He was a devout member
of the English church; but the other died in the faith of Rome: both
adhered to their political principles. On the fifteenth day of March,
Winton was brought to trial, and being convicted, received sentence of
death.

<h2>
    TRIALS OF REBELS.
</h2>
<p>
When the king passed the land-tax bill, which was ushered in with a
very extraordinary preamble, he informed both houses of the pretender's
flight from Scotland. In the beginning of April a commission for trying
the rebels met in the court of common-pleas, when bills of high
treason were found against Mr. Forster, Mackintosh, and twenty of their
confederates. Forster escaped from Newgate, and reached the continent
in safety; the rest pleaded not guilty, and were indulged with time
to prepare for their trials. The judges appointed to try the rebels
at Liverpool, found a considerable number guilty of high treason.
Two-and-twenty were executed at Preston and Manchester; about a
thousand prisoners submitted to the king's mercy, and petitioned for
transportation. Pitts, the keeper of Newgate, being suspected of having
connived at Forster's escape, was tried for his life at the Old-Bailey,
and acquitted. Notwithstanding this prosecution, which ought to have
redoubled the vigilance of the jailors, brigadier Mackintosh, and
several other prisoners, broke from Newgate, after having mastered the
keeper and turnkey, and disarmed the sentinel. The court proceeded with
the trials of those that remained, and a great number were found guilty;
four or five were hanged, drawn, and quartered, at Tyburn; and among
these was one William Paul, a clergyman, who, in his last speech,
professed himself a true and sincere member of the church of England,
but not of the revolution schismatical church, whose bishops had
abandoned the king, and shamefully given up their ecclesiastical rights,
by submitting to the unlawful, invalid, lay-deprivations authorized by
the prince of Orange.

<h2>
    ACT FOR SEPTENNIAL PARLIAMENTS.
</h2>
<p>
Though the rebellion was extinguished, the flame of national
dissatisfaction still continued to rage: the severities exercised
against the rebels increased the general discontent; for now the danger
was blown over, their humane passions began to prevail. The courage
and fortitude with which the condemned persons encountered the pains of
death in its most dreadful force, prepossessed many spectators in favour
of the cause by which those unhappy victims were animated. In a word,
persecution, as usual, extended the heresy. The ministry, perceiving
this universal dissatisfaction, and dreading the revolution of a new
parliament, which might wrest the power from their faction, and retort
upon them the violence of their own measures, formed a resolution
equally odious and effectual to establish their administration. This was
no other than a scheme to repeal the triennial act, and by a new law
to extend the term of parliaments to seven years. On the tenth day of
April, the duke of Devonshire represented, in the house of lords, that
triennial elections served to keep up party divisions; to raise and
foment feuds in private families; to produce ruinous expenses, and give
occasion to the cabals and intrigues of foreign princes; that it became
the wisdom of such an august assembly to apply proper remedies to
an evil that might be attended with the most dangerous consequences,
especially in the present temper of the nation, as the spirit of
rebellion still remained unconquered. He therefore proposed a bill for
enlarging the continuance of parliaments. He was seconded by the earls
of Dorset and Rockingham, the duke of Argyle, Lord Townshend, and the
other chiefs of that party. The motion was opposed by the earls
of Nottingham, Abingdon, and Paulet. They observed, that frequent
parliaments were required by the fundamental constitution of the
kingdom, ascertained in the practice of many ages; that the members of
the lower house were chosen by the body of the nation, for a certain
term of years, at the expiration of which they could be no longer
representatives of the people, who, by the parliament's protracting
its own authority, would be deprived of the only remedy which they have
against those who, through ignorance or corruption, betrayed the trust
reposed in them; that the reasons in favour of such a bill were weak and
frivolous; that, with respect to foreign alliances, no prince or state
could reasonably depend upon a people to defend their liberties and
interests, who should be thought to have given up so great a part of
their own; nor would it be prudent in them to wish for a change in
that constitution under which Europe had of late been so powerfully
supported; on the contrary, they might be deterred from entering into
any engagements with Great Britain, when informed by the preamble of
the bill, that the popish faction was so dangerous as to threaten
destruction to the government; they would apprehend that the
administration was so weak as to want so extraordinary a provision for
its safety; that the gentlemen of Britain were not to be trusted; and
that the good affections of the people were restrained within the
limits of the house of commons. They affirmed that this bill, far from
preventing the expense of elections, would rather increase it, and
encourage every species of corruption; for the value of a seat would
always be in proportion to the duration of a parliament, and the
purchase would rise accordingly; that a long parliament would yield
a greater temptation, as well as a better opportunity to a vicious
ministry, to corrupt the members, than they could possibly have when
the parliaments were short and frequent; that the same reasons urged for
passing the bill to continue this parliament for seven years, would be
at least as strong, and, by the conduct of the ministry, might be made
much stronger before the end of that term, for continuing and even
perpetuating their legislative power, to the absolute subversion of the
third estate of the realm. These arguments served only to form a decent
debate, after which the bill for septennial parliaments passed by a
great majority, though twenty peers entered a protest. It met with the
same fate in the lower house, where many strong objections were stated
to no purpose. They were represented as the effects of party spleen;
and, indeed, this was the great spring of action on both sides. The
question for the bill was carried in the affirmative; and in a little
time it received the royal sanction.

<h2>
    DUKE OF ARGYLE DISGRACED.
</h2>
<p>
The rebellion being utterly quelled, and all the suspected persons of
consequence detained in safe custody, the king resolved to visit his
German dominions, where he foresaw a storm gathering from the quarter
of Sweden. Charles XII. was extremely exasperated against the elector
of Hanover, for having entered into the confederacy against him in his
absence, particularly for his having purchased the duchies of Bremen and
Verden, which constituted part of his dominions; and he breathed nothing
but revenge against the king of Great Britain. It was with a view to
avert this danger, or prepare against it, that the king now determined
upon a voyage to the continent. But as he was restricted from leaving
his British dominions by the act for the further limitation of the
crown, this clause was repealed in a new bill that passed through both
houses without the least difficulty. On the twenty-sixth day of June,
the king closed the session with a speech upon the usual tonics, in
which, however, he observed, that the numerous instances of mercy he
had shown served only to encourage the faction of the pretender, whose
partisans acted with such insolence and folly, as if they intended to
convince the world that they were not to be reclaimed by gentle methods.
He intimated his purpose of visiting his dominions in Germany; and gave
them to understand, that he had constituted his beloved son, the prince
of Wales, guardian of the kingdom in his absence. About this period
general Macartney, who had returned to England at the accession of
king George, presented himself to trial for the murder of the duke of
Hamilton. The deposition of colonel Hamilton was contradicted by two
park-keepers; the general was acquitted of the charge, restored to his
rank in the army, and gratified with the command of a regiment. The
king's brother, prince Ernest, bishop of Osnabruck, was created duke of
York and Albany, and earl of Ulster. The duke of Argyle, and his brother
the earl of Hay, to whom his majesty owed, in a great measure, his
peaceable accession to the throne, as well as the extinction of the
rebellion in Scotland, were now dismissed from all their employments.
General Carpenter succeeded the duke in the chief command of the forces
in North Britain, and in the government of Port Mahon; and the duke of
Montrose was appointed lord-register of Scotland in the room of the earl
of Hay.

    THE TRIPLE ALLIANCE.
</h2>
<p>
On the seventh day of July, the king embarked at Gravesend, landed on
the ninth in Holland, through which he passed incognito to Hanover,
and from thence set out for Pyrmont. His aim was to secure his German
dominions from the Swede, and Great Britain from the pretender. These
two princes had already begun to form a design, in conjunction, of
invading his kingdom. He knew the duke of Orleans was resolved to ascend
the throne of France, in case the young king, who was a sickly child,
should die without male issue. The regent was not ignorant that Philip
of Spain would powerfully contest that succession, notwithstanding
his renunciation; and he was glad of an opportunity to strengthen his
interest by an alliance with the maritime powers of England and Holland.
The king of England sounded him on this subject, and found him eager to
engage in such an association. The negotiation was carried on by general
Cadogan for England, the abb du Bois for France, and the pensionary
Heinsius for the states-general. The regent readily complied with all
their demands. He engaged that the pretender should immediately depart
from Wignon to the other side of the Alps, and never return to Lorraine
or France on any pretence whatsoever; that no rebellious subjects of
Great Britain should be allowed to reside in that kingdom; and that the
treaty of Utrecht, with respect to the demolition of Dunkirk, should be
fully executed to the satisfaction of his Britannic majesty. The
treaty contained a mutual guarantee of all the places possessed by
the contracting powers; of the protestant succession on the throne
of England, as well as of that of the duke of Orleans to the crown of
France, and a defensive alliance, stipulating the proportion of ships
and forces to be furnished to that power which should be disturbed at
home or invaded from abroad. The English people murmured at this treaty.
They said an unnecessary umbrage was given to Spain, with which the
nation had great commercial connexions; and that on pretence of an
invasion, a body of foreign troops might be introduced to enslave the
kingdom.

<h2>
    COUNT GYLLENBURGH ARRESTED.
</h2>
<p>
His majesty was not so successful in his endeavours to appease the
king of Sweden, who refused to listen to any overtures until Bremen and
Verden should be restored. These the elector of Hanover resolved to keep
as a fair purchase; and he engaged in a confederacy with the enemies of
Charles, for the maintenance of this acquisition. Meanwhile his rupture
with Sweden was extremely prejudicial to the commerce of England, and
had well nigh entailed upon the kingdom another invasion, much more
formidable than that which had so lately miscarried. The ministers
of Sweden resident at London, Paris, and the Hague, maintained a
correspondence with the disaffected subjects of Great Britain. A
scheme was formed for the Swedish king's landing on this island with
a considerable body of forces, where he should be joined by the
malcontents of the united kingdom. Charles relished the enterprise,
which flattered his ambition and revenge; nor was it disagreeable to the
czar of Muscovy, who resented the elector's offer of joining the Swede
against the Russians, provided he would ratify the cession of Bremen
and Verden. King George having received intimation of these intrigues,
returned to England towards the end of January, and ordered a detachment
of foot-guards to secure count Gyllenburgh, the Swedish minister, with
all his papers. At the same time, sir Jacob Bancks and Mr. Charles
Caesar were apprehended. The other foreign ministers took the alarm, and
remonstrated to the ministry upon this outrage committed against the law
of nations. The two secretaries, Stanhope and Methuen, wrote circular
letters to them, assuring them that in a clay or two they should be
acquainted with the reasons that induced the king to take such an
extraordinary step. They were generally satisfied with this intimation;
but the marquis de Monteleone, ambassador from Spain, expressed his
concern that no other way could be found to preserve the peace of the
kingdom, without arresting the person of a public minister, and seizing
all his papers, which were the sacred repositories of his masters's
secrets; he observed, that in whatever manner these two facts might seem
to be understood, they very sensibly wounded the law of nations. About
the same time baron Gortz, the Swedish residentiary in Holland, was
seized with his papers at Arnheim, at the desire of king George,
communicated to the states by Mr. Loathes, his minister at the Hague.
The baron owned he had projected the invasion, a design that was
justified by the conduct of king George, who had joined the princes
in confederacy against the king of Sweden, without having received the
least provocation; who had assisted the king of Denmark in subduing the
duchies of Bremen and Verden, and then purchased them of the usurper;
and who had, in the course of this very summer, sent a strong squadron
of ships to the Baltic, where it joined the Danes and Russians against
the Swedish fleet.

<h2>
    ACCOUNT OF THE OXFORD RIOT.
</h2>
<p>
When the parliament of Great Britain met on the twentieth day of
February, the king informed them of the triple alliance he had concluded
with France and Holland. He mentioned the projected invasion; told them
he had given orders for laying before them copies of the letters which
had passed between the Scottish ministers on that subject; and he
demanded of the commons such supplies as should be found necessary for
the defence of the kingdom. By those papers it appeared that the
scheme projected by baron Gortz was very plausible, and even ripe
for execution; which, however, was postponed until the army should be
reduced, and the Dutch auxiliaries sent back to their own country. The
letters being read in parliament, both houses presented addresses, in
which they extolled the king's prudence in establishing such conventions
with foreign potentates as might repair the gross defects, and prevent
the pernicious consequences, of the treaty of Utrecht, which they termed
a treacherous and dishonourable peace; and they expressed their
horror and indignation at the malice and ingratitude of those who had
encouraged an invasion of their country. He likewise received an address
of the same kind from the convention; another from the dissenting
ministers; a third from the university of Cambridge; but Oxford was not
so lavish of her compliments. At a meeting of the vice-chancellor and
heads of that university, a motion was made for an address to the king,
on the suppression of the late unnatural rebellion, his majesty's safe
return, and the favour lately shown to the university, in omitting, at
their request, the ceremony of burning in effigy the devil, the
pope, the pretender, the duke of Ormond, and the earl of Mar, on the
anniversary of his majesty's accession. Dr. Smallridge, bishop of
Bristol, observed, that the rebellion had been long suppressed; that
there would be no end of addresses should one be presented every time
that his majesty returned from his German dominions; that the late
favour they had received was overbalanced by a whole regiment now
quartered upon them; and that there was no precedent for addressing a
king upon his return from his German dominions. The university
thought they had reason to complain of the little regard paid to their
remonstrances, touching a riot raised in that city by the soldiers there
quartered, on pretence that the anniversary of the prince's birthday had
not been celebrated with the usual rejoicings. Affidavits had been sent
up to the council, which seemed to favour the officers of the regiment.
When the house of lords deliberated upon the mutiny-bill, by which the
soldiers were exempted from arrests for debts, complaint was made of
their licentious behaviour at Oxford; and a motion was made that they
should inquire into the riot. The lords presented an address to the
king, desiring that the papers relating to that affair might be laid
before the house. These being perused, were found to be recriminations
between the Oxonians and the officers of the regiment. A warm debate
ensued, during which the earl of Abingdon offered a petition from the
vice-chancellor of the university, the mayor and magistrates of Oxford,
praying to be heard. One of the court members observing that it would
be irregular to receive a petition while the house was in a grand
committee, a motion was made that the chairman should leave the chair;
but this being carried in the negative, the debate was resumed, and the
majority agreed to the following resolutions:&mdash;That the heads of the
university, and mayor of the city, neglected to make public rejoicings
on the prince's birth-day; that the officers having met to celebrate
that day, the house in which they had assembled was assaulted, and the
windows were broken by the rabble; that this assault was the beginning
and occasion of the riots that ensued. That the conduct of the mayor
seemed well justified by the affidavits produced on his part; that
the printing and publishing the depositions upon which the complaints
relating to the riots at Oxford were founded, while that matter was
under the examination of the lords of the committee of the council,
before they had time to come to any resolution touching the same, was
irregular, disrespectful to his royal highness, and tending to sedition.
An inquiry of this nature, so managed, did not much redound to the
honour of such an august assembly.
</p>
<center>
<p class="side">1717</p>
</center>
<p>
The commons passed a bill prohibiting all commerce with Sweden, a branch
of trade which was of the utmost consequence to the English merchants.
They voted ten thousand seamen for the ensuing year; granted about a
million for the maintenance of guards, garrisons, and land-forces; and
passed the bill relating to mutiny and desertion. The house likewise
voted four-and-twenty thousand pounds for the payment of four battalions
of Munster, and two of Saxe-Gotha, which the king had taken into his
service, to supply the place of such as might be, during the rebellion,
drawn from the garrisons of the states-general to the assistance of
England. This vote, however, was not carried without a violent debate.
The demand was inveighed against as an imposition, seeing no troops
had ever served. A motion was made for an address, desiring that the
instructions of those who concluded the treaties might be laid before
the house; but this was over-ruled by the majority. The supplies were
raised by a land-tax of three shillings in the pound, and a malt-tax.
What the commons had given was not thought sufficient for the expense
of the year; therefore Mr. secretary Stanhope brought a message from his
majesty, demanding an extraordinary supply, that he might be the better
enabled to secure his kingdoms against the danger with which they were
threatened from Sweden; and he moved that a supply should be granted
to his majesty for this purpose. Mr. Shippen observed it was a great
misfortune that the king was as little acquainted with the parliamentary
proceedings as with the language of the country: that the message was
unparliamentary and unprecedented; and, in his opinion, penned by some
foreign minister: he said he had been often told that his majesty
had retrieved the honour and reputation of the nation; a truth which
appeared in the flourishing condition of trade; but that the supply
demanded seemed to be inconsistent with the glorious advantages
which his majesty had obtained for the people. He was seconded by Mr.
Hungerford, who declared that for his part he could not understand what
occasion there was for new alliances; much less that they should be
purchased with money. He expressed his surprise that a nation so lately
the terror of France and Spain should now seem to fear so inconsiderable
an enemy as the king of Sweden. The motion was supported by Mr.
Boscawen, sir Gilbert Heathcote, and others; but some of the whigs spoke
against it; and Mr. Robert Walpole was silent. The speaker, and Mr.
Smith, one of the tellers of the exchequer, opposed this unparliamentary
way of demanding the supply: the former proposed that part of the army
should be disbanded, and the money applied towards the making good
such new engagements as were deemed necessary. After several successive
debates, the resolution for a supply was carried by a majority of four
voices.
</p>
<pre>
     * This year was rendered famous by a complete victory which,
     prince Eugene obtained over the Turks at Peterwaradin upon
     the Danube. The battle was fought upon the fifth day of
     August. The Imperial army did not exceed sixty thousand men;
     that of the infidels amounted to one hundred and fifty
     thousand, commanded by the grand vizier, who was mortally
     wounded in the engagement. The infidels were totally
     defeated, with the loss of all their tents, artillery, and
     baggage, so that the victors obtained an immense booty.

<h2>
    DIVISION IN THE MINISTRY.
</h2>
<p>
The ministry was now divided within itself. Lord Townshend had been
removed from the office of secretary of state, by the intrigues of the
earl of Sunderland; and he was now likewise dismissed from the place
of lord-lieutenant of Ireland. Mr. Robert Walpole resigned his posts of
first commissioner of the treasury and chancellor of the exchequer: his
example was followed by Mr. Pulteney, secretary at war, and Mr. Methuen,
secretary of state. When the affair of the supply was resumed in the
house of commons, Mr. Stanhope made a motion for granting two hundred
and fifty thousand pounds for that purpose. Mr. Pulteney observed, that
having resigned his place, he might no w act with the freedom becoming
an Englishman: he declared against the manner of granting the supply, as
unparliamentary and unprecedented. He said he could not persuade himself
that any Englishman advised his majesty to send such a message; but he
doubted not the resolution of a British parliament would make a German
ministry tremble. Mr. Stanhope having harangued the house in vindication
of the ministry, Mr. Smith answered every article of his speech: he
affirmed, that if an estimate of the conduct of the ministry in relation
to affairs abroad was to be made from a comparison of their conduct
at home, they would not appear altogether so faultless as they were
represented. "Was it not a mistake," said he, "not to preserve the
peace at home, after the king had ascended the throne with the universal
applause and joyful acclamations of all his subjects? Was it not
a mistake, upon the breaking out of the rebellion, not to issue a
proclamation, to offer pardon to such as should return home peaceably,
according to the custom on former occasions of the same nature? Was it
not a mistake, after the suppression of the rebellion and the trial and
execution of the principal authors of it, to keep up animosities, and
drive people to despair, by not passing an act of indemnity, by keeping
so many persons under hard and tedious confinement; and by granting
pardons to some, without leaving them any means to subsist? Is it not
a mistake, not to trust a vote of parliament for making good such
engagements as his majesty should think proper to enter into; and
instead of that, to insist on the granting this supply in such an
extraordinary manner? Is it not a mistake, to take this opportunity to
create divisions, and render some of the king's best friends suspected
and obnoxious? Is it not a mistake, in short, to form parties and cabals
in order to bring in a bill to repeal the act of occasional conformity?"
A great number of members had agreed to this measure in private, though
at this period it was not brought into the house of commons. After
a long debate the sum was granted. These were the first-fruits of
Britain's being wedded to the interests of the continent. The elector
of Hanover quarrelled with the king of Sweden; and England was not only
deprived of a necessary branch of commerce, but even obliged to support
him in the prosecution of the war. The ministry now underwent a new
revolution. The earl of Sunderland and Mr. Addison were appointed
secretaries of state; Mr. Stanhope became first commission of the
treasury and chancellor of the exchequer.

<h2>
    THE COMMONS PASS THE SOUTH-SEA ACT, &amp;c.
</h2>
<p>
On the sixth day of May, the king, going to the house of peers, gave the
parliament to understand that the fleet under sir George Byng, which had
sailed to the Baltic to observe the motions of the Swedes, was safely
arrived in the Sound. He said he had given orders for the immediate
reduction of ten thousand soldiers, as well as directions to prepare
an act of indemnity. He desired they would take proper measures for
reducing the public debts with a just regard to parliamentary credit;
and that they would go through the public business with all possible
despatch and unanimity. Some progress had already been made in
deliberations upon the debt of the nation, which was comprehended under
the two heads of redeemable and irredeemable incumbrances. The first had
been contracted with a redeemable interest; and these the public had
a right to discharge: the others consisted of long and short annuities
granted for a greater or less number of years, which could not be
altered without the consent of the proprietors. Mr. Robert Walpole had
projected a scheme for lessening the interest and paying the capital of
those debts, before he resigned his place in the exchequer. He proposed,
in the house of commons, to reduce the interest of redeemable funds,
and offer an alternative to the proprietors of annuities. His plan was
approved; but, when he resigned his places, the ministers made some
small alterations in it, which furnished him with a pretence for
opposing the execution of the scheme. In the course of the debate,
some warm altercation passed between him and Mr. Stanhope, by which it
appeared they had made a practice of selling places and reversions. Mr.
Hungerford, standing up, said he was sorry to see two such great men
running foul of one another; that, however, they ought to be looked
upon as patriots and fathers of their country; and since they had by
mischance discovered their nakedness, the other members ought, according
to the custom of the East, to turn their backs upon them, that they
might not be seen in such a shameful condition. Mr. Boscawen moved that
the house would lay their commands upon them, that no further notice
should be taken of what had passed. He was seconded by Mr. Methuen: tha
house approved of the motion; and the speaker took their word and honour
that they should not prosecute their resentment. The money corporations
having agreed to provide cash for such creditors as should be willing to
receive their principal, the house came to certain resolutions, on which
were founded the three bills that passed into laws, under the names
of "The South-Sea act, the Bank act, and the General Fund act." The
original stock of the South-Sea company did not exceed nine millions
four hundred and seventy-one thousand three hundred and twenty-five
pounds; but the funds granted being sufficient to answer the interest
of ten millions at six per cent., the company made up that sum to the
government, for which they received six hundred thousand pounds yearly,
and eight thousand pounds a-year for management. By this act they
declared themselves willing to receive five hundred thousand pounds,
and the eight thousand for management. It was enacted, that the company
should continue a corporation until the redemption of their annuity,
towards which not less than a million should be paid at a time. They
were likewise required to advance a sum not exceeding two millions,
towards discharging the principal and interest due on the four lottery
funds of the ninth and tenth years of queen Anne. By the Bank act the
governors and company declared themselves willing to accept an annuity
of eighty-eight thousand seven hundred and fifty-one pounds, seven
shillings and tenpence halfpenny, or the principal of one million seven
hundred and seventy-five thousand and twenty-seven pounds, seventeen
shillings and tenpence halfpenny, in lieu of the present annuity,
amounting to one hundred and six thousand five hundred and one pounds,
thirteen shillings and fivepence. They also declared themselves willing
to discharge, and deliver up to be cancelled, as many exchequer-bills
as amounted to two millions, and to accept of an annuity of one hundred
thousand pounds, being after the rate of five per cent, redeemable after
one year's notice; to circulate the remaining exchequer-bills at
three per cent, and one penny per day. It was enacted, that the former
allowances should be continued to Christmas, and then the bank should
have for circulating the two millions five hundred and sixty-one
thousand and twenty-five pounds remaining exchequer-bills, an annuity of
seventy-six thousand eight hundred and thirty pounds, fifteen shillings,
at the rate of three pounds per cent, till redeemed, over and above the
one penny a-day for interest. By the same acts the bank was required to
advance a sum not exceeding two millions five hundred thousand pounds,
towards discharging the national debt, if wanted, on condition that they
should have five pounds per cent, for as much as they might advance,
redeemable by parliament. The General Fund act recited several acts of
parliament, for establishing the four lotteries in the ninth and tenth
years of the late queen, and stated the annual produce of the several
funds, amounting in all to seven hundred and twenty-four thousand eight
hundred and forty-nine pounds, six shillings and tenpence one-fifth.
This was the General Fund; the deficiency of which was to be made good
annually out of the first aids granted by parliament. For the regular
payment of all such annuities as should be made payable by this act, it
was enacted, that all the duties and revenues mentioned therein should
continue for ever, with the proviso, however, that the revenues
rendered by this act perpetual should be subject to redemption. This
act contained a clause by which the sinking fund was established. The
reduction of interest to five per cent, producing a surplus or excess
upon the appropriated funds, it was enacted, that all the monies arising
from time to time, as well for the surplus, by virtue of the acts for
redeeming the funds of the hank and of the South-Sea Company, as also
for the surplus of the duties and revenues by this act appropriated to
make good the general fund, should be appropriated and employed for
the discharging the principal and interest of such national debt as was
incurred before the twenty-fifth of December of the preceding year, in
such a manner as should be directed and appointed by any future act
of parliament, to be discharged out of the game, and for no other use,
intent, or purpose whatsoever.

<h2>
    TRIAL OF THE EARL OF OXFORD.
</h2>
<p>
The earl of Oxford, who had now remained almost two years a prisoner in
the Tower, presented a petition to the house of lords, praying that his
imprisonment might not be indefinite. Some of the tory lords affirmed
that the impeachment was destroyed and determined by the prorogation of
parliament, which superseded the whole proceedings; but the contrary was
voted by a considerable majority. The thirteenth day of June was fixed
for the trial; and the house of commons made acquainted with this
determination. The commons appointed a committee to inquire into the
state of the earl's impeachment; and, in consequence of their report,
sent a message to the lords demanding longer time to prepare for trial.
Accordingly the day was prolonged to the twenty-fourth of June; and the
commons appointed the committee, with four other members, to be managers
for making good the articles of impeachment. At the appointed time
the peers repaired to the court in Westminster-hall, where lord Cowper
presided as lord steward. The commons were assembled as a committee of
the whole house; the king, the rest of the royal family, and the foreign
ministers, assisted at the solemnity; the earl of Oxford was brought
from the Tower; the articles of impeachment were read, with his answers,
and the replication of the commons. Sir Joseph Jekyll standing up to
make good the first article, lord Har-court signified to their lordships
that he had a motion to make, and they adjourned to their own house.
There he represented that a great deal of time would be unnecessarily
consumed in going through all the articles of the impeachment; that if
the commons would make good the two articles for high treason, the earl
of Oxford would forfeit both life and estate, and there would be an end
of the matter; whereas to proceed on the method proposed by the commons,
would draw the trial on to a prodigious length. He therefore moved that
the commons might not be permitted to proceed until judgment should be
first given upon the articles of high treason. He was supported by the
earls of Anglesea and Nottingham, the lord Trevor, and a considerable
number of both parties; and though opposed by the earl of Sunderland,
the lords Coningsby and Parker, the motion was carried in the
affirmative. It produced a dispute between the two houses. The commons,
at a conference, delivered a paper containing their reasons for
asserting it as their undoubted right to impeach a peer either for
treason, or for high crimes and misdemeanors; or, should they see
occasion, to mix both in the same accusation. The house of lords
insisted on their former resolution; and, in another conference,
delivered a paper wherein they asserted it to be a right inherent in
every court of justice, to order and direct such methods of proceeding
as it should think fit to be observed in all causes that fell under its
cognizance. The commons demanded a free conference, which was refused.
The dispute grew more and more warm. The lords sent a message to the
lower house, importing that they intended presently to proceed on
the trial of the earl of Oxford. The commons paid no regard to this
intimation; but adjourned to the third day of July. The lords, repairing
to Westminster-hall, took their places, ordered the earl to be brought
to the bar, and made proclamation for his accusers to appear. Having
waited a quarter of an hour, they adjourned to their own house,
where, after some debate, the earl was acquitted upon a division; then
returning to the hall, they voted that he should be set at liberty.
Oxford owed his safety to the dissensions among the ministers, and to
the late change in the administration. In consequence of this, he
was delivered from the persecution of Walpole; and numbered among his
friends the dukes of Devonshire and Argyle, the earls of Nottingham and
Hay, and lord Townshend. The commons, in order to express their sense
of his demerit, presented an address to the king, desiring he might be
excepted out of the intended act of grace. The king promised to comply
with their request; and in the meantime forbade the earl to appear at
court. On the fifteenth day of July, the earl of Sunderland delivered
in the house of peers the act of grace, which passed through both houses
with great expedition. From this indulgence were excepted the earl of
Oxford, Mr. Prior, Mr. Thomas Harley, Mr. Arthur Moore; Crisp, Nodes,
O'Bryan, Redmarne the printer, and Thompson; as also the assassinators
in Newgate, and the clan of Macgregor in Scotland. By virtue of this
act, the earl of Carnwath, the lords Widrington and Nairn, were
immediately discharged; together with all the gentlemen under sentence
of death in Newgate, and those that were confined on account of the
rebellion in the Fleet, the Marshalsea, and other prisons of the
kingdom. The act of grace being prepared for the royal assent, the king
went to the house of peers on the fifteenth day of July, and having
given his sanction to all the bills that were ready, closed the session
with a speech on the usual topics.

<h2>
    PROCEEDINGS IN THE CONVOCATION WITH REGARD TO DR. HOADLEY.
</h2>
<p>
The proceedings in the convocation turned chiefly upon two performances
of Dr. Hoadley, bishop of Bangor. One was intituled, "A Preservative
against the Principles and Practices of the Nonjurors;" the other was a
sermon preached before the king, under the title of "The Nature of the
Kingdom of Christ." An answer to this discourse was published by
Dr. Snape, master of Eton college, and this convocation appointed a
committee to examine the bishop's two performances. They drew up a
representation in which the Preservative and the Sermon were censured,
as tending to subvert all government and discipline in the church of
Christ; to reduce his kingdom to a state of anarchy and confusion; to
impugn and impeach the royal supremacy in causes ecclesiastical, and the
authority of the legislature to enforce obedience in matters of religion
by civil sanctions. The government thought proper to put a stop to these
proceedings by a prorogation; which, however, inflamed the controversy.
A great number of pens were drawn against the bishop, but his chief
antagonists were Dr. Snape and Dr. Sherlock, whom the king removed from
the office of his chaplains; and the convocation has not been permitted
to sit and do business since that period.

<h2>
    DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE KING AND THE CZAR OF MUSCOVY.
</h2>
<p>
During these transactions, the negotiations of the north were continued
against the king of Sweden, who had penetrated into Norway, and advanced
towards Christianstadt, the capital of that kingdom. The czar had sent
five-and-twenty thousand Russians to assist the allies in the reduction
of Wismar, which he intended to bestow upon his niece, lately married
to the duke of Mecklenburgh-Schwerin: but before his troops arrived
the place had surrendered, and the Russians were not admitted into the
garrison; a circumstance which increased the misunderstanding between
him and the king of Great Britain. Nevertheless, he consented to a
project for making a descent upon Schonen, and actually took upon him
the command of the allied fleet; though he was not at all pleased to
see sir John Norris in the Baltic, because he had formed designs against
Denmark, which he knew the English squadron would protect. He suddenly
desisted from the expedition against Schonen, on pretence that the
season was too far advanced; and the king of Denmark published a
manifesto, remonstrating against his conduct on this occasion. By this
time baron Gortz had planned a pacification between his master and the
czar, who was discontented with all his German allies, because they
opposed his having any footing in the empire. This monarch arrived at
Amsterdam in December, whether he was followed by the czarina; and he
actually resided at the Hague when king George passed through it, in
returning to his British dominions, but he declined an interview with
the king of England. When Gyllenburgh's letters were published in
London, some passages seemed to favour the supposition of the czar's
being privy to the conspiracy. His minister at the English court
presented a long memorial, complaining that the king had caused to be
printed the malicious insinuations of his enemies. He denied his having
the least concern in the design of the Swedish king. He charged the
court of England with having privately treated of a separate peace with
Charles, and even with having promised to assist him against the czar,
on condition that he would relinquish his pretensions to Bremen and
Verden. Nevertheless, he expressed an inclination to re-establish the
ancient good understanding, and to engage in vigorous measures for
prosecuting the war against the common enemy. The memorial was answered
by the king of Great Britain, who assured the czar he should have reason
to be fully satisfied, if he would remove the only obstacle to their
mutual good understanding; in other words, withdraw the Russian troops
from the empire. Notwithstanding these professions, the two monarchs
were never perfectly reconciled.

<h2>
    THE KING OF SWEDEN IS KILLED.
</h2>
<p>
The czar made an excursion to the court of France, where he concluded
a treaty of friendship with the regent, at whose earnest desire he
promised to recall his troops from Mecklenburgh. At his return to
Amsterdam, he had a private interview with Gortz, who, as well as
Gyllenburgh, had been set at liberty. Gortz undertook to adjust all
difference between the czar and the king of Sweden within three months;
and Peter engaged to suspend all operations against Sweden until that
term should be expired. A congress was opened at Abo, between the
Swedish and Russian ministers, but the conferences were afterwards
removed to Aland. By this convention, the czar obliged himself to assist
Charles in the conquest of Norway; and they promised to unite all their
forces against the king of Great Britain should he presume to interpose.
Both were incensed against that prince; and one part of their design
was to raise the pretender to the throne of England. Baron Gortz set out
from Aland for Frederickstadt in Norway, with the plan of peace: but,
before he arrived, Charles was killed by a cannon ball from the town, as
he visited the trenches, on the thirtieth of November. Baron Gortz
was immediately arrested, and brought to the scaffold by the nobles of
Sweden, whose hatred he had incurred by his insolence of behaviour. The
death of Charles was fortunate for king George. Sweden was now obliged
to submit; while the czar, the king of Denmark, and the elector of
Hanover, kept possession of what they had acquired in the course of the
war.

<h2>
    NEGOTIATION FOR A QUADRUPLE ALLIANCE.
</h2>
<p>
Thus Bremen and Verden were secured in the house of Hanover; an
acquisition towards which the English nation contributed by her money,
as well as by her arms; an acquisition made in contradiction to
the engagements into which England entered when king William became
guarantee for the treaty of Travendahl; an acquisition that may be
considered as the first link of a political chain by which the English
nation were dragged back into expensive connexions with the continent.
The king had not yet received the investiture of the duchies; and, until
that should be procured, it was necessary to espouse with warmth the
interests of the emperor. This was another source of misunderstanding
between Great Britain and Spain. Prince Eugene gained another complete
victory over a prodigious army of the Turks at Belgrade, which was
surrendered to him after the battle. The emperor had engaged in this war
as an ally of the Venetians, whom the Turks had attacked and driven
from the Morea. The pope considered it as a religious war against the
infidels, and obtained repeated assurances from the king of Spain
that he would not undertake any thing against the emperor while he was
engaged in such a laudable quarrel. Philip had even sent a squadron of
ships and galleys to the assistance of the Venetians. In the course of
this year, however, he equipped a strong armament, the command of which
was bestowed on the marquis de Lede, who sailed from Barcelona in July,
and landing at Cagliari in Sardinia, which belonged to the emperor,
made a conquest of the whole island. At the same time, the king of Spain
endeavoured to justify these proceedings by a manifesto, in which he
alleged that the archduke, contrary to the faith of treaties, encouraged
and supported the rebellion of his subjects in Catalonia, by frequent
succours from Naples and other places; and that the great inquisitor
of Spain had been seized, though furnished with a passport from his
holiness. He promised however to proceed no further, and suspend all
operations, that the powers of Europe might have time and opportunity
to contrive expedients for reconciling all differences, and securing
the peace and balance of power in Italy; nay, he consented that this
important affair should be left to the arbitration of king George and
the states-general. These powers undertook the office. Conferences
were begun between the ministers of the emperor, France, England, and
Holland; and these produced, in the course of the following year, the
famous quadruple alliance. In this treaty it was stipulated, that the
emperor should renounce all pretensions to the crown of Spain, and
exchange Sardinia for Sicily with the duke of Savoy; that the succession
to the duchies of Tuscany, Parma, and Placentia, which the queen of
Spain claimed by inheritance as princess of the house of Farnese, should
be settled on her eldest son, in case the present possessors should die
without male issue. Philip, dissatisfied with this partition, continued
to make formidable preparations by sea and land. The king of England
and the regent of France interposed their admonitions to no purpose. At
length his Britannic majesty had recourse to more substantial arguments,
and ordered a strong squadron to be equipped with all possible
expedition. <a href="#note-206" name="noteref-206">206</a> <i>[See note 2 H, at the end of this Vol.]</i>

<h2>
    PROCEEDINGS IN PARLIAMENT.
</h2>
<p>
On the third day of November, the princess of Wales was delivered of
a prince, the ceremony of whose baptism was productive of a difference
between the grandfather and the father. The prince of Wales intended
that his uncle, the duke of York, should stand godfather. The king
ordered the duke of Newcastle to stand for himself. After the ceremony,
the prince expressed his resentment against this nobleman in very warm
terms. The king ordered the prince to confine himself within his own
apartment; and afterwards signified his pleasure that he should quit the
palace of St. James'. He retired with the princess to a house belonging
to the earl of Grantham; but the children were detained at the palace.
All peers and peeresses, and all privy-counsellors and their wives, were
given to understand, that in case they visited the prince and princess
they should have no access to his majesty's presence; and all who
enjoyed posts and places under both king and prince, were obliged to
quit the service of one or other at their option. When the parliament
met on the twenty-first day of November, the king, in his speech, told
both houses that he had reduced the army to very near one half, since
the beginning of the last session: he expressed his desire that all
those who were friends to the present happy establishment, might
unanimously concur in some proper method for the greater strengthening
the protestant interest, of which, as the church of England was
unquestionably the main support and bulwark, so would she reap the
principal benefit of every advantage accruing from the union and mutual
charity of all protestants. After the addresses of thanks, which
were couched in the usual style, the commons proceeded to take into
consideration the estimates and accounts, in order to settle the
establishment of the army, navy, and ordnance. Ten thousand men were
voted for the sea service. When the supply for the army fell under
deliberation, a very warm debate ensued upon the number of troops
necessary to be maintained. Sir William Wyndham, Mr. Shippen, and Mr.
Walpole, in a long elaborate harangue, insisted upon its being reduced
to twelve thousand. They were answered by Mr. Craggs, secretary at war,
and sir David Dalrymple. Mr. Shippen, in the course of the debate, said
the second paragraph of the king's speech seemed rather to be calculated
for the meridian of Germany than for Great Britain; and it was a
great misfortune that the king was a stranger to our language and
constitution. Mr. Lechmere affirmed this was a scandalous invective
against the king's person and government; and moved that he who uttered
it should be sent to the Tower. Mr. Shippen, refusing to retract or
excuse what he had said, was voted to the Tower by a great majority;
and the number of standing forces was fixed at sixteen thousand three
hundred and forty-seven effective men.
</p>
<p>
On account of the great scarcity of silver coin, occasioned by the
exportation of silver and the importation of gold, a motion was made to
put a stop to this growing evil, by lowering the value of gold specie.
The commons examined a representation which had been made to the
treasury by sir Isaac Newton, master of the mint, on this subject. Mr.
Caswel explained the nature of a clandestine trade carried on by the
Dutch and Ham-burghers, in concert with the Jews of England and other
traders, for exporting the silver coin and importing gold, which being
coined at the mint yielded a profit of fifteen pence upon every guinea.
The house, in an address to the king, desired that a proclamation might
be issued, forbidding all persons to utter or receive guineas at a
higher rate than one-and-twenty shillings each. His majesty complied
with that request: but people hoarding up their silver in hopes that the
price of it would be raised, or in apprehension that the gold would be
lowered still farther, the two houses resolved that the standard of the
gold and silver coins of the kingdom should not be altered in fineness,
weight, or denomination, and they ordered a bill to be brought in to
prevent the melting down of the silver coin. At this period, one James
Shepherd, a youth of eighteen, apprentice to a coachmaker, and an
enthusiast in jacobitism, sent a letter to a nonjuring clergyman,
proposing a scheme for assassinating king George. He was immediately
apprehended, owned the design, was tried, condemned, and executed at
Tyburn. This was likewise the fate of the marquis de Palleotti, an
Italian nobleman, brother to the duchess of Shrewsbury. He had, in a
transport of passion, killed his own servant; and seemed indeed to be
disordered in his brain. After he had received sentence of death, the
king's pardon was earnestly solicited by his sister the duchess, and
many other persons of the first distinction; but the common people
became so clamorous, that it was thought dangerous to rescue him from
the penalties of the law, which he accordingly underwent in the most
ignominious manner. No subject produced so much heat and altercation
in parliament during this session, as did the bill for regulating the
land-forces, and punishing mutiny and desertion: a bill which was looked
upon as an encroachment upon the liberties and constitution of England,
inasmuch as it established martial law, which wrested from the civil
magistrate the cognizance of crimes and misdemeanors committed by the
soldiers and officers of the army; a jurisdiction inconsistent with the
genius and disposition of the people. The dangers that might accrue from
such a power were explained in the lower house by Mr. Hutchinson, Mr.
Harley, and Mr. Robert Walpole, which last, however, voted afterwards
for the bill. In the house of lords, it was strenuously opposed by the
earls of Oxford, Strafford, and lord Harcourt. Their objections were
answered by lord Carteret. The bill passed by a great majority; but
divers lords entered a protest. This affair being discussed, a bill was
brought in for vesting in trustees the forfeited estates in Britain
and Ireland, to be sold for the use of the public; for giving relief to
lawful creditors by determining the claims, and for the more effectual
bringing into the respective exchequers the rents and profits of the
estates till sold. The time of claiming was prolonged; the sum of twenty
thousand pounds was reserved out of the sale of the estates in Scotland,
for erecting schools; and eight thousand pounds for building barracks
in that kingdom. The king having signified, by a message to the house
of commons, that he had lately received such information from abroad,
as gave reason to believe that a naval force employed where it should be
necessary, would give weight to his endeavours; he therefore thought fit
to acquaint the house with this circumstance, not doubting but that
in case he should be obliged, at this critical juncture, to exceed the
number of men granted this year for the sea-service, the house would
provide for such exceeding. The commons immediately drew up and
presented an address, assuring his majesty that they would make good
such exceedings of seamen as he should find necessary to preserve the
tranquillity of Europe. On the twenty-first day of March, the king went
to the house of peers, and having passed the bills that were ready for
the royal assent, ordered the parliament to be prorogued.*

<h2>
    NATURE OF THE QUADRUPLE ALLIANCE.
</h2>
<p>
The king of Spain, by the care and indefatigable diligence of his prime
minister, cardinal Alberoni, equipped a very formidable armament, which,
in the beginning of June, set sail from Barcelona towards Italy; but the
destination of it was not known. A strong squadron having been fitted
out in England, the marquis de Monteleone, ambassador from Spain,
presented a memorial to the British ministry, importing that so powerful
an armament in time of peace could not but give umbrage to the king his
master, and alter the good intelligence that subsisted between the two
crowns. In answer to this representation, the ministers declared that
the king intended to send admiral Byng with a powerful squadron into
the Mediterranean, to maintain the neutrality in Italy. Meanwhile,
the negotiations between the English and French ministers produced the
quadruple alliance, by which king George and the regent prescribed a
peace between the emperor, the king of Spain, and the king of Sicily,
and undertook to compel Philip and the Savoyard to submit to such
conditions as they had concerted with his Imperial majesty. These powers
were allowed only three months to consider the articles, and declare
whether they would reject them, or acquiesce in the partition. Nothing
could be more contradictory to the true interests of Great Britain than
this treaty, which destroyed the balance in Italy, by throwing such
an accession of power into the hands of the house of Austria. It
interrupted the commerce with Spain; involved the kingdom in an
immediate war with that monarchy; and gave rise to all the quarrels and
disputes which have arisen between England and Spain in the sequel. The
states-general did not approve of such violent measures, and for some
time kept aloof; but at length they acceded to the quadruple alliance,
which indeed was no other than a very expensive compliment to the
emperor, who was desirous of adding Sicily to his other Italian
dominions.

<h2>
    ADMIRAL BYNG SAILS.
</h2>
<p>
The king of England had used some endeavours to compromise the
difference between his Imperial majesty and the Spanish branch of the
house of Bourbon. Lord Stanhope had been sent to Madrid with a plan of
pacification, which being rejected by Philip as partial and iniquitous,
the king determined to support his mediation by force of arms. Sir
George Byng sailed from Spithead on the fourth day of June, with
twenty ships of the line, two fire-ships, two bomb-vessels, and ample
instructions how to act on all emergencies. He arrived off Cape St.
Vincent on the thirtieth day of the month, and despatched his secretary
to Cadiz, with a letter to colonel Stanhope, the British minister
at Madrid, desiring him to inform his most catholic majesty of the
admiral's arrival in those parts, and lay before him this article of his
instructions: "You are to make instances with both parties to cease from
using any further acts of hostility: but in case the Spaniards do still
insist, with their ships of war and forces, to attack the kingdom of
Naples, or other the territories of the emperor in Italy, or to land
in any part of Italy, which can only be with a design to invade the
emperor's dominions, against whom only they have declared war by
invading Sardinia; or, if they should endeavour to make themselves
masters of the kingdom of Sicily, which must be with a design to invade
the kingdom of Naples; in which case you are, with all your power,
to hinder and obstruct the same. If it should so happen that at your
arrival with our fleet under your command, in the Mediterranean, the
Spaniards should already have landed any troops in Italy in order
to invade the emperor's territories, you shall endeavour amicably to
dissuade them from persevering in such an attempt, and offer them your
assistance to help them to withdraw their troops, and put an end to all
further acts of hostility. But in case these your friendly endeavours
should prove ineffectual, you shall, by keeping company with, or
intercepting their ships or convoy; or if it be necessary, by openly
opposing them, defend the emperor's territories from any further
attempt." When cardinal Alberoni perused these instructions, he told
colonel Stanhope, with some warmth, that his master would run all
hazards, and even suffer himself to be driven out of Spain, rather
than recall his troops, or consent to a suspension of arms. He said the
Spaniards were not to be frightened; and he was so well convinced that
the fleet would do their duty, that in case of their being attacked
by Admiral Byng, he should be in no pain for the success. Mr. Stanhope
presenting him with a list of the British squadron, he threw it upon the
ground with great emotion. He promised, however, to lay the admiral's
letter before the king, and to let the envoy know his majesty's
resolution. Such an interposition could not but be very provoking to the
Spanish minister, who had laid his account with the conquest of
Sicily, and for that purpose prepared an armament which was altogether
surprising, considering the late shattered condition of the Spanish
affairs. But he seems to have put too much confidence in the strength
of the Spanish fleet. In a few days he sent back the admiral's letter
to Mr. Stanhope, with a note under it, importing that the chevalier Byng
might execute the orders he had received from the king his master.

<div style="height: 4em;"><br><br><br><br></div>

<h2>
    HE DESTROYS THE SPANISH FLEET.
</h2>
<p>
The admiral, in passing by Gibraltar, was joined by vice-admiral
Cornwall with two ships. He proceeded to Minorca, where he relieved the
garrison of Port-Mahon. Then he sailed for Naples, where he arrived
on the first day of August, and was received as a deliverer; for the
Neapolitans had been under the utmost terror of an invasion from the
Spaniards. Sir George Byng received intelligence from the viceroy, count
Daun, who treated him with the most distinguishing marks of respect,
that the Spanish army, amounting to thirty thousand men, commanded by
the marquis de Lede, had landed in Sicily, reduced Palermo and Messina,
and were then employed in the siege of the citadel belonging to this
last city; that the Piedmontese garrison would be obliged to surrender
if not speedily relieved; that an alliance was upon the carpet
between the emperor and the king of Sicily, which last had desired the
assistance of the Imperial troops, and agreed to receive them into the
citadel of Messina. The admiral immediately resolved to sail thither,
and took under his convoy a reinforcement of two thousand Germans for
the citadel, under the command of general Wetzel. He forthwith sailed
from Naples, and on the ninth day of August was in sight of the Faro
of Messina. He despatched his own captain with a polite message to the
marquis de Lede, proposing a cessation of arms in Sicily for two months,
that the powers of Europe might have time to concert measures for
restoring a lasting peace; and declaring, that should this proposal be
rejected, he would, in pursuance of his instructions, use all his force
to prevent further attempts to disturb the dominions his master had
engaged to defend. The Spanish general answered, that he had no powers
to treat, and consequently could not agree to an armistice, but should
obey his orders, which directed him to reduce Sicily for his master the
king of Spain. The Spanish fleet had sailed from the harbour of Messina
on the day before the English squadron appeared. Admiral Byng supposed
they had retired to Malta, and directed his course towards Messina,
in order to encourage and support the garrison in the citadel. But in
doubling the point of Faro, he descried two Spanish scouts, and learned
from the people of a felucca from the Calabrian shore, that they had
seen from the hills the Spanish fleet lying to in order of battle. The
admiral immediately detached the German troops to Reggio, under the
convoy of two ships of war. Then he stood through the Faro after the
Spanish scouts that led him to their main fleet, which before noon he
descried in line of battle, amounting to seven-and-twenty sail large
and small, besides two fire-ships, four bomb-vessels, and seven galleys.
They were commanded in chief by don Antonio de Castanita, under whom
were the four rear-admirals Chacon, Mari, Guevara, and Cammock. At
sight of the English squadron they stood away large, and Byng gave
chase all the rest of the day. In the morning, which was the eleventh
of August, rear-admiral de Mari, with six ships of war, the galleys,
fire-ships, and bomb-ketches, separated from the main fleet, and stood
in for the Sicilian shore. The English admiral detached captain Walton
with five ships in pursuit of them; and they were soon engaged. He
himself continued to chase their main fleet; and about ten o'clock the
battle began. The Spaniards seemed to be distracted in their councils,
and acted in confusion. They made a running fight; yet the admirals
behaved with courage and activity, in spite of which they were all
taken, except Cammock, who made his escape with three ships of war and
three frigates. In this engagement, which happened off Cape
Passaro, captain Haddock of the Grafton signalized his courage in an
extraordinary manner. On the eighteenth the admiral received a letter*
from captain Walton, dated off Syracuse, intimating that he had taken
four Spanish ships of war, together with a bomb-ketch, and a vessel
laden with arms: and that he had burned four ships of the line, a
fire-ship, and a bomb vessel.
</p>
<pre>
     * This letter is justly deemed a curious specimen of the
     laconic style. "Sir,&mdash;<i>We have taken and destroyed all the
     Spanish ships and vessels which were upon the coast; the
     number as per margin. I am, &amp;c.</i>
     G. WALTON."
</pre>
<p>
Had the Spaniards followed the advice of rear-admiral Cammock, who was a
native of Ireland, sir George Byng would not have obtained such an easy
victory. That officer proposed that they should remain at anchor in the
road of Paradise, with their broadsides to the sea; in which case the
English admiral would have found it a very difficult task to attack
them; for the coast is so bold, that the largest ships could ride with a
cable ashore; whereas farther out the currents are so various and rapid,
that the English squadron could not have come to anchor, or lie
near them in order of battle; besides the Spaniards might have been
reinforced from the army on shore, which would have raised batteries to
annoy the assailants. Before king George had received an account of this
engagement from the admiral, he wrote him a letter with his own hand,
approving his conduct. When sir George's eldest son arrived in England
with a circumstantial account of the action, he was graciously received,
and sent back with plenipotentiary powers to his father, that he might
negotiate with the several princes and states of Italy, as he should
see occasion. The son likewise carried the king's royal grant to
the officers and seamen, of all the prizes they had taken from the
Spaniards. Notwithstanding this victory, the Spanish army carried on
the siege of the citadel of Messina with such vigour, that the governor
surrendered the place by capitulation on the twenty-ninth day of
September. A treaty was now concluded at Vienna between the emperor
and the duke of Savoy. They agreed to form an army for the conquest of
Sardinia in behalf of the duke; and in the meantime this prince engaged
to evacuate Sicily; but until his troops could be conveyed from that
island, he consented that they should co-operate with the Germans
against the common enemy. Admiral Byng continued to assist the
Imperialists in Sicily during the best part of the winter, by scouring
the seas of the Spaniards, and keeping the communication open between
the German forces and the Calabrian shore, from whence they were
supplied with provisions. He acted in this service with equal conduct,
courage, resolution, and activity. He conferred with the viceroy of
Naples and the other Imperial generals, about the operations of the
ensuing campaign, and count Hamilton was despatched to Vienna to lay
before the emperor the result of their deliberations; then the admiral
set sail for Mahon, where the ships might be refitted and put in a
condition to take the sea in the spring.

<h2>
    REMONSTRANCES OF THE SPANISH MINISTRY.
</h2>
<p>
The destruction of the Spanish fleet was a subject that employed the
deliberations and conjectures of all the politicians in Europe. Spain
exclaimed against the conduct of England, as inconsistent with the
rules of good faith, for the observation of which she had always been
so famous. The marquis de Monteleone wrote a letter to Mr. secretary
Craggs, in which he expostulated with him upon such an unprecedented
outrage. Cardinal Alberoni, in a letter to that minister, inveighed
against it as a base unworthy action. He said the neutrality of Italy
was a weak pretence, since every body knew that neutrality had long been
at an end; and that the prince's guarantees of the treaty of Utrecht
were entirely discharged from their engagements, not only by the
scandalous infringements committed by the Austrians in the evacuation
of Catalonia and Majorca; but also because the guarantee was no longer
binding than till a peace was concluded with France. He taxed the
British ministry with having revived and supported this neutrality, not
by an amicable mediation, but by open violence, and artfully abusing
the confidence and security of the Spaniards. This was the language of
disappointed ambition. Nevertheless it must be owned that the conduct of
England, on this occasion, was irregular, partial, and precipitate.
</p>
<p>
The parliament meeting on the eleventh day of November, the king in his
speech declared that the court of Spain had rejected all his amicable
proposals, and broke through their most solemn engagements for the
security of the British commerce. To vindicate, therefore, the faith of
his former treaties, as well as to maintain those he had lately made,
and to protect and defend the trade of his subjects, which had in every
branch been violently and unjustly oppressed, it became necessary for
his naval forces to check their progress; that notwithstanding the
success of his arms, that court had lately given orders at all the
ports of Spain and of the West Indies to fit out privateers against the
English. He said he was persuaded that a British parliament would enable
him to resent such treatment; and he assured them that his good brother,
the regent of France, was ready to concur with him in the most vigorous
measures. A strong opposition was made in both houses to the motion
for an address of thanks and congratulation proposed by lord Carteret.
Several peers observed that such an address was, in effect, to approve
a sea-fight, which might be attended with dangerous consequences, and
to give the sanction of that august assembly to measures which, upon
examination, might appear either to clash with the law of nations or
former treaties, or to be prejudicial to the trade of Great Britain;
that they ought to proceed with the utmost caution and maturest
deliberation, in an affair wherein the honour as well as the interest
of the nation were so highly concerned. Lord Strafford moved for an
address, that sir George Byng's instructions might be laid before the
house. Earl Stanhope replied, that there was no occasion for such an
address, since by his majesty's command he had already laid before
the house the treaties of which the late sea-fight was a consequence;
particularly the treaty for a defensive alliance between the emperor and
his majesty, concluded at Westminster on the twenty-fifth day of May,
in the year one thousand seven hundred and sixteen; and the treaty of
alliance for restoring and settling the public peace, signed at London
on the twenty-second day of July. He affirmed that the court of Spain
had violated the treaty of Utrecht, and acted against the public faith
in attacking the emperor's dominions, while he was engaged in a war
against the enemies of Christendom; that they had rejected his majesty's
friendly offices and offers for mediating an accommodation. He explained
the cause of his own journey to Spain, and his negotiations at Madrid.
He added, it was high time to check the growth of the naval power of
Spain, in order to protect and secure the trade of the British subjects
which had been violently oppressed by the Spaniards. After a long
debate, the motion was carried by a considerable majority. The same
subject excited disputes of the same nature in the house of commons,
where lord Hinchinbroke moved that, in their address of thanks, they
should declare their entire satisfaction in those measures which the
king had already taken for strengthening the protestant succession,
and establishing a lasting tranquillity in Europe. The members in the
opposition urged that it was unparliamentary and unprecedented, on the
first day of the session, to enter upon particulars; that the business
in question was of the highest importance, and deserved the most mature
deliberation; that, before they approved the measures which had been
taken, they ought to examine the reasons on which those measures were
founded. Mr. Robert Walpole affirmed that the giving sanction, in the
manner proposed, to the late measures, could have no other view than
that of screening ministers, who were conscious of having begun a
war against Spain, and now wanted to make it the parliament's war. He
observed, that instead of an entire satisfaction, they ought to express
their entire dissatisfaction with such conduct as was contrary to the
law of nations, and a breach of the most solemn treaties. Mr. secretary
Craggs, in a long speech, explained the nature of the quadruple
alliance, and justified all the measures which had been taken. The
address, as moved by lord Hinchinbroke, was at length carried, and
presented to his majesty. Then the commons proceeded to consider the
supply. They voted thirteen thousand five hundred sailors; and twelve
thousand four hundred and thirty-five men for the land service. The
whole estimate amounted to two millions two hundred and fifty-seven
thousand five hundred eighty-one pounds, nineteen shillings. The money
was raised by a land-tax, malt-tax, and lottery.

<h2>
    ACT FOR STRENGTHENING THE PROTESTANT INTEREST.
</h2>
<p>
On the thirteenth day of December, earl Stanhope declared, in the house
of lords, that in order to unite the hearts of the well affected to the
present establishment, he had a bill to offer under the title of "An
act for strengthening the protestant interest in these kingdoms." It was
accordingly read, and appeared to be a bill repealing the acts against
occasional conformity, the growth of schism, and some clauses in the
corporation and test acts. This had been concerted by the ministry in
private meetings with the most eminent dissenters. The tory lords were
astonished at this motion, for which they were altogether unprepared.
Nevertheless they were strenuous in their opposition. They alleged that
the bill, instead of strengthening, would certainly weaken the church of
England, by plucking off her best feathers, investing her enemies with
power, and sharing with churchmen the civil and military employments
of which they were then wholly possessed. Earl Cowper declared himself
against that part of the bill by which some clauses of the test and
corporation acts were repealed; because he looked upon those acts as the
main bulwark of our excellent constitution in church and state, which
ought to be inviolably preserved. The earl of Hay opposed the bill,
because, in his opinion, it infringed the <i>pacta conventa</i> of the treaty
of union, by which the bonds both of the church of England and of the
church of Scotland were fixed and settled; and he was apprehensive,
if the articles of the union were broke with respect to one church, it
might afterwards be a precedent to break them with respect to the other.
The archbishop of Canterbury said the acts which by this bill would be
repealed, were the main bulwark and supporters of the English church;
he expressed all imaginable tenderness for well-meaning conscientious
dissenters; but he could not forbear saying, some among that sect made a
wrong use of the favour and indulgence shown to them at the revolution,
though they had the least share in that happy event; it was therefore
thought necessary for the legislature to interpose, and put a stop to
the scandalous practice of occasional conformity. He added, that it
would be needless to repeal the act against schism, since no advantage
had been taken of it to the prejudice of the dissenters. Dr. Hoadley,
bishop of Bangor, endeavoured to prove that the occasional and schism
acts were in effect persecuting laws; and that by admitting the
principle of self-defence and self-preservation in matters of religion,
all the persecutions maintained by the heathens against the professors
of Christianity, and even the popish inquisition, might be justified.
With respect to the power of which many clergymen appeared so fond and
so zealous, he owned the desire of power and riches was natural to all
men; but that he had learned both from reason and from the gospel, that
this desire must be kept within due bounds, and not intrench upon the
rights and liberties of their fellow-creatures and countrymen. After a
long debate, the house agreed to leave out some clauses concerning the
test and corporation acts: then the bill was committed, and afterwards
passed. In the lower house it met with violent opposition, in spite of
which it was carried by the majority.

<h2>
    WAR DECLARED AGAINST SPAIN.
</h2>
<p>
The king on the seventeenth day of December, sent a message to the
commons, importing that all his endeavours to procure redress for
the injuries done to his subjects by the king of Spain having proved
ineffectual, he had found it necessary to declare war against that
monarch. When a motion was made for an address, to assure the king they
would cheerfully support him in the prosecution of the war, Mr. Shippen
and some other members said, they did not see the necessity of involving
the nation in a war on account of some grievances of which the merchants
complained, as these might be amicably redressed. Mr. Stanhope assured
the house that he had presented five-and-twenty memorials to the
ministry of Spain on that subject without success. Mr. Methuen accounted
for the dilatory proceeds of the Spanish court in commercial affairs, by
explaining the great variety of regulations in the several provinces
and ports of that kingdom. It was suggested that the ministry paid very
little regard to the trade and interest of the nation, inasmuch as it
appeared by the answer from the secretary of state to the letter of the
marquis de Monteleone, that they would have overlooked the violation
of the treaties of commerce, provided Spain had accepted the conditions
stipulated in the quadruple alliance; for it was there expressly said,
that his majesty the king of Great Britain did not seek to aggrandize
himself by any new acquisitions, but was rather inclined to sacrifice
something of his own to procure the general quiet and tranquillity of
Europe. A member observed, that nobody could tell how far that sacrifice
would have extended, but certainly it was a very uncommon stretch of
condescension. This sacrifice was said to be the cession of Gibraltar
and Port Mahon, which the regent of France had offered to the king
of Spain, provided he would accede to the quadruple alliance. Horatio
Walpole observed, that the disposition of Sicily in favour of the
emperor was an infraction of the treaty of Utrecht; and his brother
exclaimed against the injustice of attacking the Spanish fleet before a
declaration of war. Notwithstanding all these arguments and objections,
the majority agreed to the address; and such another was carried in the
upper house without a division. The declaration of war against Spain was
published with the usual solemnities; but this war was not a favourite
of the people, and therefore did not produce those acclamations that
were usual on such occasions.

<h2>
    CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE REGENT OF FRANCE.
</h2>
<p>
Meanwhile cardinal Alberoni employed all his intrigues, power, and
industry, for the gratification of his revenge. He caused new ships to
be built, the sea ports to be put in a posture of defence, succours to
be sent to Sicily, and the proper measures to be taken for the security
of Sardinia. He, by means of the prince de Cellamare, the Spanish
ambassador at Paris, caballed with the malcontents of that kingdom, who
were numerous and powerful. A scheme was actually formed for seizing the
regent, and securing the person of the king. The duke of Orleans owed
the first intimation of this plot to king George, who gave him
to understand that a conspiracy was formed against his person and
government. The regent immediately took measures for watching the
conduct of all suspected persons; but the whole intrigue was discovered
by accident. The prince de Cellamare intrusted his despatches to the
abb Portocarrero, and to a son of the marquis de Monteleone. These
emissaries set out from Paris in a post-chaise, and were overturned.
The postillion overheard Portocarrero say, he would not have lost his
portmanteau for a hundred thousand pistoles. The man, at his return
to Paris, gave notice to the government of what he had observed. The
Spaniards, being pursued, were overtaken and seized at Poictiers, with
the portmanteau, in which the regent found two letters that made
him acquainted with the particulars of the conspiracy. The prince de
Cellamare was immediately conducted to the frontiers: the duke of Maine,
the marquis de Pompadore, the cardinal de Polignac, and many other
persons of distinction, were committed to different prisons. The regent
declared war against Spain on the twenty-ninth day of December; and an
army of six-and-thirty thousand men began its march towards that kingdom
in January, under the command of the duke of Berwick.

<h2>
    INTENDED INVASION BY ORMOND.
</h2>
<p>
Cardinal Alberoni had likewise formed a scheme in favour of the
pretender. The duke of Ormond repairing to Madrid, held conferences
with his eminence; and measures were concerted for exciting another
insurrection in Great Britain. The chevalier de St. George quitted
Urbino by stealth; and embarking at Netteno, landed at Cagliari in
March. From thence he took his passage to Roses in Catalonia, and
proceeded to Madrid, where he was received with great cordiality, and
treated as king of Great Britain. An armament had been equipped of
ten ships of war and transports, having on board six thousand regular
troops, with arms for twelve thousand men. The command of this fleet was
bestowed on the duke of Ormond, with the title of captain-general of his
most catholic majesty. He was provided with declarations in the name of
that king, importing, that for many good reasons he had sent part of his
land and sea forces into England and Scotland, to act as auxiliaries to
king James. His Britannic majesty, having received from the regent
of France timely notice of this intended invasion, offered, by
proclamations, rewards to those that should apprehend the duke of
Ormond, or any gentleman embarked in that expedition. Troops were
ordered to assemble in the north, and in the west of England: two
thousand men were demanded of the states-general: a strong squadron was
equipped to oppose the Spanish armament; and the duke of Orleans made a
proffer to king George of twenty battalions for his service.

<h2>
    THREE HUNDRED SPANIARDS LAND AND ARE TAKEN IN SCOTLAND.
</h2>
<p>
His majesty having communicated to both houses of parliament the
repeated advices he had received touching this projected descent, they
promised to support him against all his enemies. They desired he would
augment his forces by sea and land, and assured him they would make good
the extraordinary expense. Two thousand men were landed from Holland,
and six battalions of Imperialists from the Austrian Netherlands.
The duke of Ormond sailed from Cadiz, and proceeded as far as Cape
Finisterre, where his fleet was dispersed and disabled by a violent
storm, which entirely defeated the purposed expedition. Two frigates,
however, arrived in Scotland, with the earls Marischal and Seaforth, the
marquis of Tullibardine, some field-officers, three hundred Spaniards,
and arms for two thousand men. They were joined by a small body of
Highlanders, and possessed themselves of Donan castle. Against these
adventurers general Wightman marched with a body of regular troops from
Inverness. They had taken possession of the pass at Glenshiel; but, at
the approach of the king's forces, retired to the pass at Strachell,
which they resolved to defend. They were attacked and driven from one
eminence to another till night, when the Highlanders dispersed; and next
day the Spaniards surrendered themselves prisoners of war. Marischal,
Seaforth, and Tullibardine, with some officers, retired to one of the
western isles, in order to wait an opportunity of being conveyed to the
continent.

<h2>
    ACCOUNT OF THE PEERAGE BILL.
</h2>
<p>
On the last day of February the duke of Somerset represented, in the
house of lords, that the number of peers being very much increased,
especially since the union of the two kingdoms, it seemed absolutely
necessary to take effectual measures for preventing the inconveniences
that might attend the creation of a great number of peers to serve a
present purpose; an expedient which had been actually taken in the late
reign. He therefore moved that a bill should be brought in to settle
and limit the peerage, in such a manner that the number of English peers
should not be enlarged beyond six above the present number, which, upon
failure of male issue, might be supplied by new creations: that instead
of the sixteen elective peers from Scotland, twenty-five should be
made hereditary on the part of that kingdom; and that this number, upon
failure of heirs-male, should be supplied from the other members of the
Scottish peerage. This bill was intended as a restraint upon the prince
of Wales, who happened to be at variance with the present ministry.
The motion was supported by the duke of Argyle, now lord-steward of the
household, the earls of Sunderland and Carlisle. It was opposed by the
earl of Oxford, who said, that although he expected nothing from the
crown, he would never give his vote for lopping off so valuable a branch
of the prerogative, which enabled the king to reward merit and virtuous
actions. The debate was adjourned to the second day of March, when earl
Stanhope delivered a message from the king, intimating, that as they had
under consideration the state of the British peerage, he had so much at
heart the settling it upon such a foundation as might secure the freedom
and constitution of parliaments in till future ages, that he was willing
his prerogative should not stand in the way of so great and necessary
a work. Another violent debate ensued between the two factions. The
question here, as in almost every other dispute, was not whether the
measure proposed was advantageous to the nation? but, whether the tory
or the whig interest should predominate in parliament? Earl Cowper
affirmed, that the part of the bill relating to the Scottish peerage,
was a manifest violation of the treaty of union, as well as a flagrant
piece of injustice, as it would deprive persons of their right, without
being heard, and without any pretence or forfeiture on their part.
He observed, that the Scottish peers excluded from the number of the
twenty-five, would be in a worse condition than any other subjects in
the kingdom; for they would be neither electing nor elected, neither
representing nor represented. These objections were overruled; several
resolutions were taken agreeably to the motion, and the judges were
ordered to prepare and bring in the bill. This measure alarmed the
generality of Scottish peers, as well as many English commoners, who saw
in the bill the avenues of dignity and title shut up against them; and
they did not fail to exclaim against it as an encroachment upon the
fundamental maxims of the constitution. Treaties were written and
published on both sides of the question; and a national clamour began to
arise, when earl Stanhope observed, in the house, that as the bill had
raised strange apprehensions, he thought it advisable to postpone the
further consideration of it till a more proper opportunity. It was
accordingly dropped, and the parliament prorogued on the eighteenth
day of April, on which occasion his majesty told both houses that the
Spanish king had acknowledged the pretender.

<h2>
    COUNT MERCI ASSUMES THE COMMAND OF THE IMPERIAL ARMY
</h2>
<p>
The king having appointed lords-justices to rule the kingdom in his
absence, embarked in May for Holland, from whence he proceeded to
Hanover, where he concluded a peace with Ulrica, the new queen of
Sweden. By this treaty Sweden yielded for ever to the royal and
electoral house of Brunswick the duchies of Bremen and Verden, with
all their dependencies; king George obliged himself to pay a million
of rix-dollars to the queen of Sweden; and to renew, as king of Great
Britain and elector of Hanover, the alliances formerly subsisting
between his predecessors and that kingdom. He likewise mediated a peace
between Sweden and his former allies, the Danes, the Prussians, and the
Poles. The czar, however, refused to give up his schemes of conquest. He
sent his fleet to the Scheuron, or Bates of Sweden, where his troops
landing to the number of fifteen thousand, committed dreadful outrages:
but sir John Norris, who commanded an English squadron in those seas,
having orders to support the negotiations, and oppose any hostilities
that might be committed, the czar, dreading the fate of the Spanish
navy, thought proper to recall his fleet. In the Mediterranean, admiral
Byng acted with unwearied vigour in assisting the Imperialists to finish
the conquest of Sicily. The court of Vienna had agreed to send a strong
body of forces to finish the reduction of that island; and the command
in this expedition was bestowed upon the count de Merci, with whom sir
George Byng conferred at Naples. This admiral supplied them with
ammunition and artillery from the Spanish prizes. He took the whole
reinforcement under his convoy, and saw them safely landed in the bay of
Patti, to the number of three thousand five hundred horse, and ten
thousand infantry. Count Merci thinking himself more than a match for
the Spanish forces commanded by the marquis de Lede, attacked him in a
strong camp at Franca-Villa, and was repulsed with the loss of five
thousand men, himself being dangerously wounded in the action. Here his
army must have perished for want of provisions, had they not been
supplied by the English navy.

<h2>
    ACTIVITY OF ADMIRAL BYNG.
</h2>
<p>
Admiral Byng no sooner learned the bad success of the attack at
Franca-Villa, than he embarked two battalions from the garrison of
Melazzo, and about a thousand recruits, whom he sent under a convoy
through the Baro to Scheso-bay, in order to reinforce the Imperial army.
He afterwards assisted at the council ol war with the German generals,
who, in consequence of his advice, undertook the siege of Messina.
Then he repaired to Naples, where he proposed to count Gallas, the new
viceroy, that the troops destined for the conquest of Sardinia should
be first landed in Sicily, and co-operate towards the conquest of that
island. The proposal was immediately despatched to the court of Vienna.
In the meantime, the admiral returned to Sicily, and assisted at the
siege of Messina. The town surrendered; the garrison retired into the
citadel; and the remains of the Spanish navy, which had escaped at
Passaro, were now destroyed in the Mole. The emperor approved of the
scheme proposed by the English admiral, to whom he wrote a very gracious
letter, intimating that he had despatched orders to the governor of
Milan to detach the troops designed for Sardinia to Vado, in order to be
transported into Italy. The admiral charged himself with the performance
of this service. Having furnished the Imperial army before Messina with
another supply of cannon, powder, and shot, upon his own credit, he set
sail for Vado, where he surmounted numberless difficulties started by
the jealousy of count Bonneval, who was unwilling to see his troops,
destined for Sardinia, now diverted to another expedition, in which he
could not enjoy the chief command. At length admiral Byng saw the forces
embarked, and convoyed them to Messina, the citadel of which surrendered
in a few days after their arrival. By this time the marquis de Lede had
fortified a strong post at Castro-Giovanne, in the centre of the
island; and cantoned his troops about Aderno, Palermo, and Catenea.
The Imperialists could not pretend to attack him in this situation,
nor could they remain in the neighbourhood of Messina on account of the
scarcity of provisions. They would, therefore, have been obliged to
quit the island during the winter, had not the admiral undertaken to
transport them by sea to Trapani, where they could extend themselves
in a plentiful country. He not only executed this enterprise, but even
supplied them with corn from Tunis, as the harvests of Sicily had been
gathered into the Spanish magazines. It was the second day of March
before the last embarkation of the Imperial troops were landed at
Trapani.

<div style="height: 4em;"><br><br><br><br></div>

<h2>
    THE SPANISH TROOPS EVACUATE SICILY.
</h2>
<p>
The marquis de Lede immediately retired with his army to Alcamo, from
whence he sent his mareschal de camp to count Merci and the English
admiral, with overtures for evacuating Sicily. The proposals were not
disagreeable to the Germans: but sir George Byng declared that the
Spaniards should not quit the island while the war continued, as he
foresaw that these troops would be employed against France or England.
He agreed however with count Merci, in proposing that if the marquis
would surrender Palermo and retire into the middle part of the island,
they would consent to an armistice for six weeks, until the sentiments
of their different courts should be known. The marquis offered to
surrender Palermo, in consideration of a suspension of arms for three
months; but, while this negotiation was depending, he received advice
from Madrid that a general peace was concluded. Nevertheless, he broke
off the treaty in obedience to a secret order for that purpose. The king
of Spain hoped to obtain the restitution of St. Sebastian's, Fontarabia,
and other places taken in the course of the war, in exchange for the
evacuation of Sicily, Hostilities were continued until the admiral
received advice from the earl of Stair, at Paris, that the Spanish
ambassador at the Hague had signed the quadruple alliance. By the same
courier packets were delivered to the count de Merci and the marquis
de Lede, which last gave the admiral and Imperial general to understand
that he looked upon the peace as a thing concluded, and was ready to
treat for a cessation of hostilities. They insisted on his delivering
up Palermo; on the other hand he urged, that, as their masters were in
treaty for settling the terms of evacuating Sicily and Sardinia, he
did not think himself authorised to agree to a cessation, except on
condition that each party should remain on the ground they occupied, and
expect further orders from their principals. After a fruitless interview
between the three chiefs at the Cassine de Rossignola, the Imperial
general resolved to undertake the siege of Palermo; with this view he
decamped from Alcamo on the eighteenth day of April, and followed the
marquis de Lede, who retreated before him and took possession of the
advantageous posts that commanded the passes into the plain of Palermo;
but count Merci, with indefatigable diligence, marched over the
mountains, while the admiral coasted along shore, attending the motions
of the army. The Spanish general perceiving the Germans advancing into
the plain, retired under the cannon of Palermo, and fortified his camp
with strong entrenchments. On the second day of May the Germans took one
of the enemy's redoubts by surprise, and the marquis de Lede ordered
all his forces to be drawn out to retake this fortification: both armies
were on the point of engaging, when a courier arrived in a felucca with
a packet for the marquis, containing full powers to treat and agree
about the evacuation of the island, and the transportation of the army
to Spain. He forthwith drew off his army; and sent a trumpet to the
general and admiral, with letters, informing them of the orders he had
received: commissioners were appointed on each side, the negotiations
begun, and the convention signed in a very few days. The Germans
were put in possession of Palermo, and the Spanish army marched to
Tauromini, from whence they were transported to Barcelona.

<h2>
    PHILIP OBLIGED TO ACCEDE TO THE QUADRUPLE ALLIANCE.
</h2>
<p>
The admiral continued in the Mediterranean until he had seen the islands
of Sicily and Sardinia evacuated by the Spaniards, and the mutual
cessions executed between the emperor and the duke of Savoy, in
consequence of which four battalions of Piedmontese troops were
transported from Palermo to Sardinia, and took possession of Cagliari
in the name of their master. In a word, admiral Byng bore such a
considerable share in this war of Sicily, that the fate of the island
depended wholly on his courage, vigilance, and conduct. When he waited
on his majesty at Hanover, he met with a very gracious reception. The
king told him he had found out the secret of obliging his enemies as
well as his friends; for the court of Spain had mentioned him in
the most honourable terms, with respect to his candid and friendly
deportment in providing transports and other necessaries for the
embarkation of their troops, and in protecting them from oppression. He
was appointed treasurer of the navy, and rear-admiral of Great Britain:
in a little time the king ennobled him, by the title of viscount
Torrington: he was declared a privy-counsellor, and afterwards
made knight of the bath at the revival of that order. During these
occurrences in the Mediterranean, the duke of Berwick advanced with the
French army to the frontiers of Spain, where he took Port-Passage and
destroyed six ships of war that were on the stocks; then he reduced
Fontarabia and St. Sebastian's, together with Port Antonio in the bottom
of the bay of Biscay. In this last exploit the French were assisted by a
detachment of English seamen, who burned two large ships unfinished, and
a great quantity of naval stores. The king of England, with a view to
indemnify himself for the expense of the war, projected the conquest
of Corunna in Biscay, and of Peru in South America. Four thousand men,
commanded by lord Cobham, were embarked at the Isle of Wight, and sailed
on the twenty-first day of September, under convoy of five ships of war
conducted by admiral Mighels. Instead of making an attempt upon Corunna,
they reduced Vigo with very little difficulty; and Point-a-Vedra
submitted without resistance: here they found some brass artillery,
small arms, and military stores, with which they returned to England. In
the meantime captain Johnson, with two English ships of war, destroyed
the same number of Spanish ships in the port of Ribadeo, to the eastward
of Cape Ortegas, so that the naval power of Spain was totally ruined.
The expedition to the West Indies was prevented by the peace. Spain
being oppressed on all sides, and utterly exhausted, Philip saw the
necessity of a speedy pacification. He now perceived the madness of
Alberoni's ambitious projects. That minister was personally disagreeable
to the emperor, the king of England, and the regent of France, who had
declared they would hearken to no proposals while he should continue in
office: the Spanish monarch, therefore, divested him of his employment,
and ordered him to quit the kingdom in three weeks. The marquis de
Beretti Landi, minister from the court of Madrid at the Hague, delivered
a plan of pacification to the states; hat it was rejected by the allies;
and Philip was obliged at last to accede to the quadruple alliance.

<h2>
    BILL FOR SECURING THE DEPENDENCY OF IRELAND UPON THE CROWN.
</h2>
<p>
On the fourteenth day of November, king George returned to England, and
on the twenty-third opened the session of parliament with a speech, in
which he told them that all Europe, as well as Great Britain, was on the
point of being delivered from the calamities of war by the influence
of British arms and councils. He exhorted the commons to concert proper
means for lessening the debts of the nation, and concluded with a
panegyric upon his own government. It must be owned he had acted with
equal vigour and deliberation in all the troubles he had encountered
since his accession to the throne. The addresses of both houses were
as warm as he could desire. They in particular extolled him for having
interposed in behalf of the protestants of Hungary, Poland, and Germany,
who had been oppressed by the practices of the popish clergy, and
presented to him memorials containing a detail of their grievances. He
and all the other protestant powers warmly interceded in their favour,
but the grievances were not redressed. The peerage bill was now revived
by the duke of Buckingham; and, in spite of all opposition, passed
through the house of lords. It had been projected by earl Stanhope,
and eagerly supported by the earl of Sunderland; therefore, Mr.
Robert Walpole attacked it in the house of commons with extraordinary
vehemence. Here too it was opposed by a considerable number of whig
members; and, after warm debates, rejected by a large majority. The next
object that engrossed the attention of the parliament was a bill for
better securing the dependency of Ireland upon the crown of Great
Britain. Maurice Annesley had appealed to the house of peers in England,
from a decree of the house of peers in Ireland, which was reversed. The
British peers ordered the barons of the exchequer in Ireland to put Mr.
Annesley in possession of the lands he had lost by the decree in that
kingdom. The barons obeyed this order; and the Irish house of peers
passed a vote against them, as having acted in derogation to the king's
prerogative in his high court of parliament in Ireland, as also of the
rights and privileges of that kingdom, and of the parliament thereof;
they likewise ordered them to be taken into custody of the usher of
the black rod: they transmitted a long representation to the king,
demonstrating their right to the final judicature of causes: and the
duke of Leeds, in the upper house, urged fifteen reasons to support the
claim of the Irish peers. Notwithstanding these arguments, the house of
lords in England resolved that the barons of the exchequer in Ireland
had acted with courage, according to law, in support of his majesty's
prerogative, and with fidelity to the crown of Great Britain. They
addressed the king to confer on them some marks of his royal favour,
as a recompence for the ill usage they had undergone. Finally, they
prepared the bill, by which the Irish house of lords was deprived of all
right to pass sentence, affirm, or reverse any judgment or decree, given
or made in any court within that kingdom. In the house of commons it was
opposed by Mr. Pitt, Mr. Hungerford, lords Molesworth and Tyr-connel;
but was carried by the majority, and received the royal assent.

<h2>
    SOUTH-SEA ACT
</h2>
<p>
The king having recommended to the commons the consideration of proper
means for lessening the national debt, was a prelude to the famous
South-Sea act, which became productive of so much mischief and
infatuation The scheme was projected by sir John Blunt, who had been
bred a scrivener, and was possessed of all the cunning, plausibility,
and boldness requisite for such an undertaking. He communicated his plan
to Mr. Aislaby, the chancellor of the exchequer, as well as to one of
the secretaries of state. He answered all their objections; and the
project was adopted. They foresaw their own private advantage in
the execution of their design, which was imparted in the name of the
South-Sea company, of which Blunt was a director, who influenced all
their proceedings. The pretence for the scheme was to discharge
the national debt, by reducing all the funds into one. The bank and
South-Sea company outbid each other. The South-Sea company altered
their original plan, and offered such high terms to government, that
the proposals of the bank were rejected; and a bill was ordered to be
brought into the house of commons, formed on the plan presented by the
South-Sea company. While this affair was in agitation, the stock of
that company rose from one hundred and thirty to near four hundred, in
consequence of the conduct of the commons, who had rejected a motion
for a clause in the bill, to fix what share in the capital stock of the
company should be vested in those proprietors of the annuities who might
voluntarily subscribe; or how many year's purchase in money they should
receive in subscribing, at the choice of the proprietors.
</p>
<center>
<p class="side">1720</p>
</center>
<p>
In the house of lords, the bill was opposed by lord North and Grey, earl
Cowper, the dukes of Wharton, Buckingham, and other peers; they affirmed
it was calculated for enriching a few and impoverishing a great
number: that it countenanced the fraudulent and pernicious practice of
stock-jobbing, which diverted the genius of the people from trade and
industry: that it would give foreigners the opportunity to double and
treble the vast sums they had in the public funds; and they would be
tempted to realize and withdraw their capital and immense gains to other
countries; so that Great Britain would be drained of all its gold and
silver; that the artificial and prodigious rise of the South-Sea stock
was a dangerous bait, which might decoy many unwary people to their
ruin, alluring them by a false prospect of gain to part with the fruits
of their industry, to purchase imaginary riches; that the addition of
above thirty millions capital would give such power to the South-Sea
company, as might endanger the liberties of the nation; for by their
extensive interest they would be able to influence most, if not all the
elections of the members; and, consequently, over-rule the resolutions
of the house of commons. Earl Cowper urged, that in all public bargains
the individuals of the administration ought to take care, that thay
shall be more advantageous to the state than to private persons; but
that a contrary method had been followed in the contract made with the
South-Sea company; for, should the stocks be kept at the advanced price
to which they had been raised by the oblique arts of stock-jobbing,
either that company or its principal members would gain above thirty
millions, of which no more than one-fourth part would be given towards
the discharge of the national debts. He apprehended that the re-purchase
of annuities would meet with insuperable difficulties; and, in such
case, none but a few persons who were in the secret, who had bought
stocks at a low rate, and afterwards sold them at a high price, would in
the end be gainers by the project. The earl of Sunderland answered their
objections. He declared that those who countenanced the scheme of the
South-Sea company, had nothing in view but the advantage of the nation.
He owned that the managers for that company had undoubtedly a prospect
of private gain, either to themselves or to their corporation; but, he
said, when the scheme was accepted, neither the one nor the other could
foresee that the stocks would have risen to such a height; that if they
had continued as they were, the public would have had the far greater
share of the advantage accruing from the scheme; and should they be kept
up to the present high price, it was but reasonable that the South-Sea
company should enjoy the profits procured to it by the wise management
and industry of the directors, which would enable it to make large
dividends, and thereby accomplish the purpose of the scheme. The bill
passed without amendment or division; and on the seventh day of April
received the royal assent. By this act the South-Sea company was
authorised to take in, by purchase or subscription, the irredeemable
debts of the nation, stated at sixteen millions five hundred forty-six
thousand four hundred and eighty-two pounds, seven shillings and one
penny farthing, at such times as they should find convenient before the
first day of March of the ensuing year, and without any compulsion on
any of the proprietors, at such rates and prices as should be agreed
upon between the company and the respective proprietors. They were
likewise authorised to take in all the redeemable debts, amounting to
the same sum as that of the irredeemables, either by purchase, by taking
subscriptions, or by paying off the creditors. For the liberty of taking
in the national debts, and increasing their capital stock accordingly,
the company consented that their present, and to be increased annuity,
should be continued at five per cent, till Midsummer, in the year one
thousand seven hundred and twenty-seven; from thence to be reduced to
four per cent, and be redeemable by parliament. In consideration of
this, and other advantages expressed in the act, the company declared
themselves willing to make such payments into the receipt of the
exchequer as were specified for the use of the public, to be applied to
the discharge of the public debts incurred before Christmas, in the year
one thousand seven hundred and sixteen. The sums they were obliged to
pay for the liberty of taking in the redeemable debts, four years and
a half's purchase for all long and short annuities that should be
subscribed, and one year's purchase for such long annuities as should
not be subscribed, amounted on the execution of the act to about
seven millions. For enabling the company to raise this sum, they were
empowered to make calls for money from their members; to open books of
subscription; to grant annuities redeemable by the company; to borrow
money upon any contract or bill under their common seal, or on the
credit of their capital stock; to convert the money demanded of their
members into additional stock, without, however, making any addition
to the company's annuities, payable out of the public duties. It was
enacted, that out of the first monies arising from the sums paid by the
company into the exchequer, such public debts, carrying interest at five
per cent, incurred before the twenty-fifth day of December, in the year
one thousand seven hundred and sixteen, founded upon any former act
of parliament, as were now redeemable, or might be redeemed by the
twenty-fifth day of December, in the year one thousand seven hundred and
twenty-two, should be discharged in the first place: that then all the
remainder should be applied towards paying off so much of the capital
stock of the company as should then carry an interest of five per cent.
It was likewise provided, that, after Midsummer in the year one thousand
seven hundred and twenty-seven, the company should not be paid off in
any sums being less than one million at a time.

<h2>
    CHARTERS GRANTED TO THE ROYAL AND LONDON ASSURANCE OFFICES.
</h2>
<p>
The heads of the Royal-Assurance and London-Assurance companies,
understanding that the civil-list was considerably in arrears, offered
to the ministry six hundred thousand pounds towards the discharge of
that debt, on condition of their obtaining the king's charter, with
a parliamentary sanction, for the establishment of their respective
companies. The proposal was embraced; and the king communicated it in a
message to the house of commons, desiring their concurrence. A bill
was immediately passed, enabling his majesty to grant letters of
incorporation to the two companies. It soon obtained the royal assent;
and, on the eleventh day of June, an end was put to the session. This
was the age of interested projects, inspired by a venal spirit
of adventure, the natural consequence of that warice, fraud, and
profligacy, which the monied corporations had introduced. This of
all others is the most unfavourable era for an historian. A reader of
sentiment and imagination cannot be entertained or interested by a dry
detail of such transactions as admit of no warmth, no colouring, no
embellishment, a detail which serves only to exhibit an inanimate
picture of tasteless vice and mean degeneracy.

<h2>
    TREATY OF ALLIANCE WITH SWEDEN.
</h2>
<p>
By this time an alliance offensive and defensive was concluded at
Stockholm between king George and the queen of Sweden, by which his
majesty engaged to send a fleet into the Baltic to act against the czar
of Muscovy, in case that monarch should reject reasonable proposals of
peace. Peter loudly complained of the insolent interposition of king
George, alleging that he had failed in his engagements, both as elector
of Hanover and king of Great Britain. His resident at London presented
a long memorial on this subject, which was answered by the British and
Hanoverian ministry. These recriminations served only to inflame the
difference. The czar continued to prosecute the war, and at length
concluded a peace without a mediator. At the instances, however of king
George and the regent of France, a treaty of peace was signed between
the queen of Sweden and the king of Prussia, to whom that princess ceded
the city of Stetin, the district between the rivers Oder and Pehnne,
with the isles of Wollin and Usedom. On the other hand, he engaged
to join the king of Great Britain in his endeavours to effect a peace
between Sweden and Denmark, on condition that the Danish king should
restore to queen Ulrica that part of Pomerania which he had seized; he
likewise promised to pay to that queen two millions of rix-dollars in
consideration of the cessions she had made. The treaty between Sweden
and Denmark was signed at Frederickstadt in the month of June, through
the mediation of the king of Great Britain, who became guarantee for the
Dane's keeping possession of Sleswick. He consented, however, to restore
the Upper Pomerania, the isle of Rugen, the city of Wismar, and whatever
he had taken from Sweden during the war, in consideration of Sweden's
renouncing the exemption from toll in the Sound and the two Belts, and
paying to Denmark six hundred thousand rix-dollars.

<h2>
    THE PRINCE OF HESSE ELECTED KING OF SWEDEN.
</h2>
<p>
Sir John Norris had again sailed to the Baltic with a strong squadron
to give weight to the king's mediation. When he arrived at Copenhagen he
wrote a letter to prince Dolgorouki, the czar's ambassador at the court
of Denmark, signifying that he and the king's envoy at Stockholm were
vested with full powers to act jointly or separately in quality of
plenipotentiaries, in order to effect a peace between Sweden and
Muscovy, in the way of mediation. The prince answered that the czar
had nothing more at heart than peace and tranquillity; and in case his
Britannic majesty had any proposals to make to that prince, he hoped the
admiral would excuse him from receiving them, as they might be delivered
in a much more compendious way. The English fleet immediately joined
that of Sweden as auxiliaries; but they had no opportunity of acting
against the Russian squadron, which secured itself in Revel. Ulrica,
queen of Sweden, and sister to Charles XII., had married the prince of
Hesse, and was extremely desirous that he should be joined with her in
the administration of the regal power. She wrote a separate letter
to each of the four States, desiring they would confer on him the
sovereignty; and after some opposition from the nobles, he was actually
elected king of Sweden. He sent one of his general officers to notify
his elevation to the czar, who congratulated him upon his accession
to the throne: this was the beginning of a negotiation which ended in
peace, and established the tranquillity of the North. In the midst of
these transactions, king George set out from England for his Hanoverian
dominions; but before he departed from Great Britain, he was reconciled
to the prince of Wales, through the endeavours of the duke of Devonshire
and Mr. Walpole, who, with earl Cowper, lord Townshend, Mr. Methuen,
and Mr. Pulteney, were received into favour, and re-united with the
ministry. The earls of Dorset and Bridgewater were promoted to the title
of dukes; lord viscount Castleton was made an earl; Hugh Boscawen was
created a baron, and viscount Falmouth; and John Wallop baron, and
viscount Lymington.

<h2>
    EFFECTS OF THE SOUTH-SEA SCHEME.
</h2>
<p>
While the king was involved at Hanover in a labyrinth of negotiations,
the South-Sea scheme produced a kind of national delirium in his English
dominions. Blunt, the projector, had taken the hint of his plan from the
famous Mississippi scheme formed by Law, which in the preceding year had
raised such a ferment in France, and entailed rain upon many thousand
families of that kingdom. In the scheme of Law there was something
substantial. An exclusive trade to Louisiana promised some advantage;
though the design was defeated by the frantic eagerness of the people.
Law himself became the dupe of the regent, who transferred the burden
of fifteen hundred millions of the king's debts to the shoulders of the
subjects, while the projector was sacrificed as the scape-goat of
the political iniquity. The South-Sea scheme promised no commercial
advantage of any consequence. It was buoyed up by nothing but the folly
and rapaciousness of individuals, which became so blind and extravagant,
that Blunt, with moderate talents, was able to impose upon the whole
nation, and make tools of the other directors, to serve his own purposes
and those of a few associates. When this projector found that the
South-Sea stock did not rise according to his expectation upon
the bill's being passed, he circulated a report that Gibraltar and
Port-Mahon would be exchanged for some places in Teru; by which means
the English trade to the South-Sea would be protected and enlarged. This
rumour, diffused by his emissaries, acted like a contagion. In five days
the directors opened their books for a subscription of one million,
at the rate of three hundred pounds for every hundred pounds capital.
Persons of all ranks crowded to the house in such a manner that the
first subscription exceeded two millions of original stock. In a few
days this stock advanced to three hundred and forty pounds; and the
subscriptions were sold for double the price of the first payment.
Without entering into a detail of the proceedings, or explaining the
scandalous arts that were practised to enhance the value of the stock,
and decoy the unwary, we shall only observe, that by the promise of
prodigious dividends and other infamous arts, the stock was raised
to one thousand; and the whole nation infected with the spirit of
stock-jobbing to an astonishing degree. All distinction of party,
religion, sex, character, and circumstances, were swallowed up in this
universal concern, or in some such pecuniary project. Exchange-Alley was
filled with a strange concourse of statesmen and clergymen, churchmen
and dissenters, whigs and tories, physicians, lawyers, tradesmen, and
even with multitudes of females. All other professions and employments
were utterly neglected; and the people's attention wholly engrossed by
this and other chimerical schemes, which were known by the denomination
of bubbles. New companies started up every day under the countenance of
the prime nobility. The prince of Wales was constituted governor of the
Welsh copper company; the duke of Chandos appeared at the head of the
York-buildings company; the duke of Bridgewater formed a third, for
building houses in London and Westminster. About an hundred such schemes
were projected and put in execution, to the ruin of many thousands. The
sums proposed to be raised by these expedients amounted to three hundred
millions sterling, which exceeded the value of all the lands in England.
The nation was so intoxicated with the spirit of adventure, that people
became a prey to the grossest delusion. An obscure projector, pretending
to have formed a very advantageous scheme, which, however, he did not
explain, published proposals for a subscription, in which he promised
that in one month the particulars of his project should be disclosed. In
the meantime he declared that every person paying two guineas should be
entitled to a subscription for one hundred pounds, which would produce
that sum yearly. In one forenoon this adventurer received a thousand of
these subscriptions; and in the evening set out for another kingdom.
The king, before his departure, had issued a proclamation against these
unlawful projects; the lords-justices afterwards dismissed all the
petitions that had been presented for charters and patents; and the
prince of Wales renounced the company of which he had been elected
governor. The South-Sea scheme raised such a flood of eager avidity and
extravagant hope, that the majority of the directors were swept along
with it, even contrary to their own sense and inclination; but Blunt and
his accomplices still directed the stream.
</p>
<p>
The infatuation prevailed till the eighth day of September, when the
stock began to fall. Then did some of the adventurers awake from their
delirium. The number of the sellers daily increased. On the twenty-ninth
day of the month the stock had sunk to one hundred and fifty; several
eminent goldsmiths and bankers, who had lent great sums upon it, were
obliged to stop payment and abscond. The ebb of this portentous tide
was so violent, that it bore down everything in its way; and an infinite
number of families were overwhelmed with ruin. Public credit sustained
a terrible shock; the nation was thrown into a dangerous ferment; and
nothing was heard but the ravings of grief, disappointment, and despair.
Some principal members of the ministry were deeply concerned in these
fradulent transactions; when they saw the price of stock sinking daily,
they employed all their influence with the bank to support the credit of
the South-Sea company. That corporation agreed, though with reluctance,
to subscribe into the stock of the South-Sea company, valued at four
hundred per cent., three millions five hundred thousand pounds, which
the company was to repay to the bank on Lady-day and Michaelmas of the
ensuing year. This transaction was managed by Mr. Robert Walpole, who,
with his own hand, wrote the minute of agreement, afterwards known by
the name of the bank contract. Books were opened at the bank to take in
a subscription for the support of public credit; and considerable sums
of money were brought in. By this expedient the stock was raised at
first, and those who contrived it seized the opportunity to realize. But
the bankruptcy of goldsmiths and the sword-blade company, from the fall
of South-Sea stock, occasioned such a run upon the bank, that the money
was paid away faster than it could be received from the subscription.
Then the South-Sea stock sunk again; and the directors of the bank,
finding themselves in danger of being involved in that company's ruin,
renounced the agreement; which indeed they were under no obligation to
perform, for it was drawn up in such a manner as to be no more than the
rough draft of a subsequent agreement, without due form, penalty, or
clause of obligation. All expedients having failed, and the clamours
of the people daily increasing, expresses were despatched to Hanover,
representing the state of the nation, and pressing the king to return.
He accordingly shortened his intended stay in Germany, and arrived in
England on the eleventh day of November.

<h2>
    A SECRET COMMITTEE APPOINTED BY THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.
</h2>
<p>
The parliament being assembled on the eighth day of December, his
majesty expressed his concern for the unhappy turn of affairs, which had
so deeply affected the public credit at home: he earnestly desired the
commons to consider of the most effectual and speedy methods to restore
the national credit, and fix it upon a lasting establishment. The
lower house was too much interested in the calamity to postpone the
consideration of that subject. The members seemed to lay aside all party
distinctions, and vie with each other in promoting an inquiry, by which
justice might be done to the injured nation. They ordered the directors
to produce an account of all their proceedings. Sir Joseph Jekyll moved
that a select committee might be appointed to examine the particulars
of this transaction. Mr. Walpole, now paymaster of the forces, observed,
that such a method would protract the inquiry, while the public credit
lay in a bleeding condition. He told the house he had formed a scheme
for restoring public credit; but, before he would communicate this
plan, desired to know whether the subscriptions of public debts and
incumbrances, money-subscriptions and other contracts made with the
South-Sea company, should remain in the present state. After a warm
debate, the question was carried in the affirmative, with this addition,
"Unless altered for the ease and relief of the proprietors, by a general
court of the South-Sea company, or set aside in due course of law." Next
day Walpole produced his scheme,&mdash;to ingraft nine millions of South-Sea
stock into the bank of England, and the like sum into the East India
company, on certain conditions. The house voted, that proposals should
be received from the bank, and those two companies on this subject.
These being delivered the commons resolved, that an engrossment of nine
millions of the capital stock of the South-Sea company into the
capital stock of the bank and East-India company, as proposed by these
companies, would contribute very much to the restoring public credit.
A bill upon this resolution was brought in, passed through both houses,
and received the royal assent. Another bill was enacted into a law, for
restraining the sub-governor, deputy-governor, directors, treasurer,
under-treasurer, cashier, secretary, and accountants, of the South-Sea
company, from quitting the kingdom till the end of the next session
of parliament; and for discovering their estates and effects, so as to
prevent them from being transported or alienated. A committee of secrecy
was chosen by ballot, to examine all the books, papers, and proceedings
relating to the execution of the South-Sea act.
</p>
<p>
The lords were not less eager than the commons to prosecute this
inquiry, though divers members in both houses were deeply involved in
the guilt and infamy of the transaction. Earl Stanhope said the estates
of the criminals, whether directors or not directors, ought to be
confiscated, to repair the public losses. He was seconded by lord
Carteret, and even by the earl of Sunderland. The duke of Wharton
declared he would give up the best friend he had should he be found
guilty. He observed, that the nation had been plundered in a most
flagrant and notorious manner; therefore, they ought to find out and
punish the offenders severely, without respect to persons. The sub and
deputy-governors, the directors and officers of the South-Sea company,
were examined at the bar of the house. Then a bill was brought in,
disabling them to enjoy any office in that company, or in the East-India
company, or in the bank of England. Three brokers were likewise
examined, and made great discoveries. Knight, the treasurer of the
South-Sea company, who had been entrusted with the secrets of the
whole affair, thought proper to withdraw himself from the kingdom. A
proclamation was issued to apprehend him; and another for preventing any
of the directors from escaping out of the kingdom. At this period, the
secret committee informed the house of commons that they had already
discovered a train of the deepest villany and fraud that hell ever
contrived to ruin a nation, which in due time they would lay before the
house; in the meanwhile, they thought it highly necessary to secure the
persons of some of the directors and principal officers of the South-Sea
company, as well as to seize their papers. An order was made to secure
the books and papers of Knight, Surman, and Turner. The persons of sir
George Caswell, sir John Blunt, sir John Lambert, sir John Fellows,
and Mr. Grigsby, were taken into custody; sir Theodore Janssen, Mr.
Sawbridge, sir Robert Chaplain, and Mr. Eyles, were expelled the house
and apprehended. Mr. Aislaby resigned his employments of chancellor of
the exchequer and lord of the treasury; and orders were given to remove
all directors of the South-Sea company from the places they possessed
under the government.
</p>
<p>
The lords, in the course of their examination, discovered that large
portions of South-Sea stock had been given to several persons in the
administration and house of commons, for promoting the passing of the
South-Sea act. The house immediately resolved, that this practice was a
notorious and most dangerous species of corruption: that the directors
of the South-Sea company having ordered great quantities of their stock
to be bought for the service of the company, when it was at a very high
price, and on pretence of keeping up the price of stock; and at the
same time several of the directors, and other officers belonging to the
company, having, in a clandestine manner, sold their own stock to the
company, such directors and officers were guilty of a notorious fraud
and breach of trust, and their so doing was one great cause of the
unhappy turn of affairs that had so much affected public credit. Many
other resolutions were taken against that infamous confederacy, in
which, however, the innocent were confounded with the guilty. Sir John
Blunt refusing to answer certain interrogations, a violent debate arose
about the manner in which he should be treated. The duke of Wharton
observed, that the government of the best princes was sometimes rendered
intolerable to their subjects by bad ministers: he mentioned the example
of Sejanus, who had made a division in the imperial family, and rendered
the reign of Cladius hateful to the Romans. Earl Stanhope conceiving
this reflection was aimed at him, was seized with a transport of anger.
He undertook to vindicate the ministry; and spoke with such vehemence as
produced a violent headache, which obliged him to retire. He underwent
proper evacuations, and seemed to recover; but next day, in the evening,
became lethargic, and being seized with a suffocation, instantly
expired. The king deeply regretted the death of this favourite minister,
which was the more unfortunate as it happened at such a critical
conjuncture; and he appointed lord Town-shend to fill his place of
secretary. Earl Stanhope was survived but a few days by the other
secretary Mr. Craggs, who died of the small-pox on the sixteenth day of
February. Knight, the cashier of the South-Sea company, being seized at
Tirlemont by the vigilance of Mr. Gandot, secretary to Mr. Loathes the
British resident at Brussels, was confined in the citadel of Antwerp.
Application was made to the court of Vienna, that he should be delivered
to such persons as might be appointed to receive him; but he had found
means to interest the states of Brabant in his behalf. They insisted
upon their privilege granted by charter, that no person apprehended for
any crime in Brabant should be tried in any other country. The house
of commons expressed their indignation at this frivolous pretence;
instances were renewed to the emperor; and in the meantime Knight
escaped from the citadel of Antwerp.

<h2>
    SEVERE RESOLUTIONS AGAINST THE SOUTH-SEA COMPANY.
</h2>
<p>
The committee of secrecy found, that, before any subscription could
be made, a fictitious stock of five hundred and seventy-four thousand
pounds had been disposed of by the directors, to facilitate the
passing the bill. Great part of this was distributed among the earl of
Sunderland, Mr. Craggs, senior, the duchess of Kendal, the countess
of Platen and her two nieces, Mr. Secretary Craggs, and Mr. Aislaby
chancellor of the exchequer. In consequence of the committee's report,
the house came to several severe, though just, resolutions against the
directors and officers of the South-Sea company; and a bill was prepared
for the relief of the unhappy sufferers. Mr. Stanhope, one of the
secretaries of the treasury, charged in the report with having large
quantities of stock and subscriptions, desired that he might have an
opportunity to clear himself. His request was granted; and the affair
being discussed, he was cleared by a majority of three voices. Fifty
thousand pounds in stock had been taken by Knight for the use of the
earl of Sunderland. Great part of the house entered eagerly into
this inquiry; and a violent dispute ensued. The whole strength of
the ministry was mustered in his defence. The majority declared him
innocent: the nation in general was of another opinion. He resigned his
place of first commissioner in the treasury, which was bestowed upon Mr.
Robert Walpole; but he still retained the confidence of his master. With
respect to Mr. Aislaby, the evidence appeared so strong against him,
that the commons resolved, he had promoted the distinctive execution
of the South-Sea scheme, with a view to his own exorbitant profit, and
combined with the directors in their pernicious practices to the ruin
of public credit. He was expelled the house, and committed to the Tower.
Mr. Craggs, senior, died of a lethargy, before he underwent the censure
of the house. Nevertheless they resolved that he was a notorious
accomplice with Robert Knight, and some of the directors, in carrying on
their scandalous practices; and therefore, that all the estate of which
he was possessed, from the first day of December in the preceding year,
should be applied towards the relief of the unhappy sufferers in the
South-Sea company. The directors, in obedience to the orders of the
house, delivered in inventories of their estates, which were confiscated
by act of parliament, towards making good the damages sustained by the
company, after a certain allowance was deducted for each according to
his conduct and circumstances.

<p>
The delinquents being thus punished by the forfeiture of their fortunes,
the house converted their attention to means for repairing the
mischiefs which the scheme had produced. This was a very difficult task,
on account of the contending interests of those engaged in the South-Sea
company, which rendered it impossible to relieve some but at the expense
of others. Several wholesome resolutions were taken, and presented with
an address to the king, explaining the motives of their proceedings. On
the twenty-ninth day of July, the parliament was prorogued for two days
only. Then his majesty going to the house of peers, declared that he
had called them together again so suddenly, that they might resume the
consideration of the state of public credit. The commons immediately
prepared a bill upon the resolutions they had taken. The whole capital
stock, at the end of the year one thousand seven hundred and twenty,
amounted to about thirty-seven millions eight hundred thousand pounds.
The stock allotted to all the proprietors did not exceed twenty-four
millions five hundred thousand pounds; the remaining capital stock
belonged to the company in their corporate capacity. It was the profit
arising from the execution of the South-Sea scheme; and out of this
the bill enacted, that seven millions should be paid to the public. The
present act likewise directed several additions to be made to the stock
of the proprietors, out of that possessed by the company in their own
right; it made a particular distribution of stock, amounting to two
millions two hun dred thousand pounds; and upon remitting five millions
of the seven to be paid to the public, annihilated two millions of their
capital. It was enacted, that, after these distributions, the remaining
capital stock should be divided among all the proprietors. This dividend
amounted to thirty-three pounds six shillings and eight-pence per cent,
and deprived the company of eight millions nine hundred thousand pounds.
They had lent above eleven millions on stock unredeemed; of which the
parliament discharged all the debtors, upon their paying ten per cent.
Upon this article the company's loss exceeded six millions nine hundred
thousand pounds, for many debtors refused to make any payment. The
proprietors of the stock loudly complained of their being deprived of
two millions; and the parliament in the sequel revived that sum which
had been annihilated. While this affair was in agitation, petitions
from counties, cities, and boroughs, in all parts of the kingdom, were
presented to the house, crying for justice against the villany of
the directors. Pamphlets and papers were daily published on the same
subject; so that the whole nation was exasperated to the highest pitch
of resentment. Nevertheless, by the wise and vigorous resolutions of
the parliament, the South-Sea company was soon in a condition to fulfil
their engagements with the public; the ferment of the people subsided;
and the credit of the nation was restored.

<h2>
    BILL AGAINST ATHEISM.
</h2>
<p>
During the infatuation produced by this infamous scheme, luxury, vice,
and profligacy, increased to a shocking degree of extravagance. The
adventurers, intoxicated by their imaginary wealth, pampered themselves
with the rarest dainties, and the most expensive wines that could be
imported; they purchased the most sumptuous furniture, equipage, and
apparel, though without taste or discernment; they indulged their
criminal passions to the most scandalous excess; their discourse was the
language of pride, insolence, and the most ridiculous ostentation; they
affected to scoff at religion and morality, and even to set heaven at
defiance. The earl of Nottingham complained in the house of lords of the
growth of atheism, profaneness, and immorality; and a bill was brought
in for suppressing blasphemy and profaneness. It contained several
articles seemingly calculated to restrain the liberty granted to
nonconformists by the laws of the last session: for that reason it
met with violent opposition. It was supported by the archbishop of
Canterbury, the earl of Nottingham, lords Bathurst and Trevor, the
bishops of London, Winchester, and Litchfield and Coventry. One of
these said, he verily believed the present calamity occasioned by
the South-Sea project, was a judgment of God on the blasphemy and
profaneness of the nation. Lord Onslow replied, "That noble peer must
then be a great sinner, for he has lost considerably by the South-Sea
scheme." The duke of Wharton, who had rendered himself famous by his wit
and profligacy, said he was not insensible of the common opinion of
the town concerning himself, and gladly seized this opportunity of
vindicating his character, by declaring he was far from being a patron
of blasphemy, or an enemy to religion. On the other hand, he could not
but oppose the bill, because he conceived it to be repugnant to the holy
scripture. Then pulling an old family bible from his pocket, he quoted
several passages from the epistles of St. Peter and St. Paul;
concluding with a desire that the bill might be thrown out. The earl of
Peterborough declared, that though he was for a parliamentary king,
yet he did not desire to have a parliamentary God, or a parliamentary
religion; and, should the house declare for one of this kind, he would
go to Rome and endeavour to be chosen a cardinal; for he had rather
sit in a conclave than with their lordships upon those terms. After a
vehement debate, the bill was postponed to a long day, by a considerable
majority. The season was far advanced before the supplies were granted;
and at length they were not voted with that cheerfulness and good humour
which the majority had hitherto manifested on such occasions. On the
sixteenth day of June, the king sent a message to the house of commons,
importing, that he had agreed to pay a subsidy to the crown of Sweden,
and he hoped they would enable him to make good his engagements. The
leaders of the opposition took fire at this intimation. They desired to
know whether this subsidy, amounting to seventy-two thousand pounds, was
to be paid to Sweden over and above the expense of maintaining a strong
squadron in the Baltic? Lord Molesworth observed, that, by our late
conduct, we were become the allies of the whole world, and the bubbles
of all our allies: for we were obliged to pay them well for their
assistance. He affirmed that the treaties which had been made with
Sweden at different times, were inconsistent and contradictory; that
our late engagements with that crown were contrary to the treaties
subsisting with Denmark, and directly opposite to the measures formerly
concerted with the czar of Muscovy. He said, that in order to engage the
czar to yield what he had gained in the course of the war, the king
of Prussia ought to give up Stetin, and the elector of Hanover
restore Bremen and Verden; that, after all, England had no business to
intermeddle with the affairs of the empire; that we reaped little or
no advantage by our trade to the Baltic, but that of procuring naval
stores; he owned that hemp was a very necessary commodity, particularly
at this juncture; but he insisted that if due encouragement were given
to some of our plantations in America, we might be supplied from thence
at a much cheaper rate than from Sweden and Norway. Notwithstanding
these arguments, the Swedish supply was granted; and, in about three
weeks, their complaisance was put to another proof. They were given
to understand, by a second message, that the debts of the civil list
amounted to five hundred and fifty thousand pounds; and his majesty
hoped they would empower him to raise that sum upon the revenue, as he
proposed it should be replaced in the civil list, and reimbursed by a
deduction from the salaries and wages of all officers, as well as from
the pensions and other payments from the crown. A bill was prepared for
this purpose, though not without warm opposition; and, at the same time,
an act passed for a general pardon. On the tenth day of August, the king
closed the session with a speech, in which he expressed his concern
for the sufferings of the innocent, and a just indignation against the
guilty, with respect to the South-Sea scheme. These professions were
judged necessary to clear his own character, which had incurred the
suspicion of some people, who whispered that he was not altogether free
from connexions with the projectors of that design; that the emperor
had, at his desire, refused to deliver up Knight; and that he favoured
the directors and their accomplices.

<h2>
    ALLIANCE BETWEEN GREAT BRITAIN, FRANCE, AND SPAIN.
</h2>
<p>
Lords Townshend and Carteret were now appointed Secretaries of state;
and the earl of Hay was vested with the office of lord privy-seal of
Scotland. In June the treaty of peace between Great Britain and Spain
was signed at Madrid. The contracting parties engaged to restore
mutually all the effects seized and confiscated on both sides. In
particular, the king of England promised to restore all the ships of the
Spanish fleet which had been taken in the Mediterranean, or the value of
them, if they were sold. He likewise promised, in a secret article, that
he would no longer interfere in the affairs of Italy: and the king of
Spain made an absolute cession of Gibraltar and Port Mahon. At the same
time a defensive alliance was concluded between Great Britain, France,
and Spain. All remaining difficulties were referred to a congress at
Cambray, where they hoped to consolidate a general peace, by determining
all differences between the emperor and his catholic majesty. In the
meantime the powers of Great Britain, France, and Spain, engaged, by
virtue of the present treaty, to grant to the duke of Parma a particular
protection for the preservation of his territories and rights, and
for the support of his dignity. It was also stipulated that the
states-general should be invited to accede to this alliance. The
congress at Cambray was opened; but the demands on both sides were so
high, that it proved ineffectual. In the meantime, the peace between
Russia and Sweden was concluded, on condition that the czar should
retain Livonia, Ingria, Estonia, part of Carelia, and of the territory
of Wyburg, Riga, Revel, and Nerva, in consideration of his restoring
part of Finland, and paying two millions of rix-dollars to the king of
Sweden. The personal animosity subsisting between king George and the
czar seemed to increase. Bastagif, the Russian resident at London,
having presented a memorial that contained some unguarded expressions,
was ordered to quit the kingdom in a fortnight. The czar published a
declaration at Petersburgh, complaining of this outrage, which, he
said, ought naturally to have engaged him to use reprisals; but as he
perceived it was done without any regard to the concerns of England,
and only in favour of the Hanoverian interest, he was unwilling that the
English nation should suffer for a piece of injustice in which they had
no share. He, therefore, granted to them all manner of security, and
free liberty to trade in all his dominions. To finish this strange
tissue of negotiations, king George concluded a treaty with the Moors of
Africa, against which the Spaniards loudly exclaimed.

<h2>
    PLAGUE AT MARSEILLES.
</h2>
<p>
In the course of this year pope Clement XI. died; and the princess
of Wales was delivered of a prince, baptized by the name of
William-Augustus, the late duke of Cumberland. A dreadful plague raging
at Marseilles, a proclamation was published, forbidding any person to
come into England, from any part of France between the Bay of Biscay and
Dunkirk, without certificates of health. Other precautions were taken
to guard against contagion. An act of parliament had passed in the
preceding session, for the prevention of infection, by building
pest-houses, to which all infected persons, and all persons of an
infected family, should be conveyed; and by drawing trenches and lines
round any city, town, or place infected. The king, in his speech at
opening the session of parliament on the nineteenth day of October,
intimated the pacification of the north, by the conclusion of the treaty
between Muscovy and Sweden. He desired the house of commons to consider
of means for easing the duties upon the imported commodities used in
the manufactures of the kingdom. He observed, that the nation might be
supplied with naval stores from our own colonies in North America; and
that their being employed in this useful and advantageous branch of
commerce, would divert them from setting up manufactures which directly
interfered with those of Great Britain. He expressed a desire that, with
respect to the supplies, his people might reap some immediate benefit
from the present circumstances of affairs abroad; and he earnestly
recommended to their consideration, means for preventing the plague,
particularly by providing against the practice of smuggling.

<h2>
    DEBATES IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS ABOUT MR. LAW.
</h2>
<p>
One of the first objects that attracted the attention of the upper house
was the case of John Law, the famous projector. The resentment of the
people on account of his Mississippi scheme had obliged him to leave
France. He retired to Italy; and was said to have visited the pretender
at Rome. From thence he repaired to Hanover; and returned to England
from the Baltic, in the fleet commanded by sir John Norris. The king
favoured him with a private audience; he kept open house, and was
visited by great numbers of persons of the first quality. Earl Coningsby
represented in the house of lords that he could not but entertain some
jealousy of a person who had done so much mischief in a neighbouring
kingdom; who, being immensely rich, might do a great deal more hurt
here, by tampering with those who were grown desperate, in consequence
of being involved in the calamity occasioned by the fatal imitation
of his pernicious projects. He observed, that this person was the more
dangerous, as he had renounced his natural affection to his country, his
allegiance to his lawful sovereign, and his religion, by turning Roman
catholic. Lord Carteret replied, that Mr. Law had, many years ago, the
misfortune to kill a gentleman in a duel; but, having at last received
the benefit of the king's clemency, and the appeal lodged by the
relations of the deceased being taken off, he was come over to plead his
majesty's pardon. He said there was no law to keep an Englishman out of
his country; and, as Mr. Law was a subject of Great Britain, it was
not even in the king's power to hinder him from coming over. After some
dispute, the subject was dropped, and this great projector pleaded his
pardon in the king's bench according to the usual form.

<h2>
    SENTIMENTS OF SOME LORDS TOUCHING THE WAR.
</h2>
<p>
The ministry had by this time secured such a majority in both houses,
as enabled them to carry any point without the least difficulty. Some
chiefs of the opposition they had brought over to their measures, and
among the rest lord Harcourt, who was created a viscount, and gratified
with a pension of four thousand pounds. Nevertheless they could not
shut the mouths of the minority, who still preserved the privilege of
complaining. Great debates were occasioned by the navy debt, which was
increased to one million seven hundred thousand pounds. Some members in
both houses affirmed, that such extraordinary expense could not be for
the immediate service of Great Britain; but, in all probability, for the
preservation of foreign acquisitions. The ministers answered, that near
two-thirds of the navy debts were contracted in the late reign; and the
parliament acquiesced in this declaration; but in reality the navy debt
had been unnecessarily increased, by keeping seamen in pay during the
winter, and sending fleets to the Mediterranean and Baltic in order to
support the interests of Germany. The duke of Wharton moved that the
treaty with Spain might be laid before the house. The earl of Sunderland
said it contained a secret article which the king of Spain desired
might not be made public until after the treaty of Cambray should be
discussed. The question was put, and the duke's motion rejected.
The earl of Strafford asserted, that as the war with Spain had been
undertaken without necessity or just provocation, so the peace was
concluded without any benefit or advantage; that, contrary to the law of
nations, the Spanish fleet had been attacked without any declaration
of war; even while a British minister and a secretary of state were
treating amicably at Madrid; that the war was neither just nor politic,
since it interrupted one of the most valuable branches of the English
commerce, at a time when the nation groaned under the pressure of heavy
debts, incurred by the former long expensive war. He therefore moved for
an address to his majesty, desiring that the instructions given to sir
George Byng, now lord Torrington, should be laid before the house.
This motion being likewise, upon the question, rejected, a protest was
entered. They voted an address, however, to know in what manner the king
had disposed of the ships taken from the Spaniards. Disputes arose from
the bill to prevent infection. Earl Cowper represented, that the removal
of persons to a lazaret, or pest-house, by order of the government,
and the drawing lines and trenches round places infected, were powers
unknown to the British constitution; inconsistent with the lenity of
a free government, such as could never be wisely or usefully put in
practice; the more odious, because copied from the arbitrary government
of France; and impracticable, except by military compulsion. Those
obnoxious clauses were accordingly repealed, though not without great
opposition. Indeed, nothing can be more absurd than a constitution that
will not admit of just and necessary laws and regulations to prevent
the dire consequences of the worst of all calamities. Such restrictions,
instead of favouring the lenity of a free government, would be the most
cruel imposition that could be laid on a free people, as it would act in
diametrical opposition to the great principles of society, which is the
preservation of the individual.

<h2>
    PETITION OF THE QUAKERS..
</h2>
<p>
The quakers having presented a petition to the house of commons, praying
that a bill might be brought in for omitting in their solemn affirmation
the words "In the presence of Almighty God," the house complied with
their request: but the bill gave rise to a warm debate among the peers.
Dr. Atterbury, bishop of Rochester, said he did not know why such a
distinguishing mark of indulgence should be allowed to a set of people
who were hardly christians. He was supported by the archbishop of York,
the earl of Strafford, and lord North and Grey. A petition was presented
against the bill by the London clergy, who expressed a serious concern
lest the minds of good men should be grieved and wounded, and the
enemies of Christianity triumph, when they should see such condescension
made by a christian legislature to a set of men who renounce the divine
institutions of Christ; particularly that by which the faithful are
initiated into his religion, and denominated christians. The petition,
though presented by the archbishop of York, was branded by the ministry
as a seditious libel, and rejected by the majority. Then, upon a motion
by the earl of Sunderland, the house resolved that such lords as might
enter protestations with reasons, should do it before two o'clock on
the next sitting day, and sign them before the house rises. The supplies
being granted, and the business of the session despatched as the court
was pleased to dictate, on the seventh day of March the parliament
was prorogued. In a few days it was dissolved, and another convoked by
proclamation. In the election of members for the new parliament, the
ministry exerted itself with such success as returned a great majority
in the house of commons, extremely well adapted for all the purposes of
an administration. *
</p>
<pre>
     * The earl of Sunderland died in April, after having
     incurred a great load of popular odium, from his supposed
     connexions with the directors of the South-Sea company. He
     was a minister of abilities, but violent, impetuous, and
     headstrong. His death was soon followed by that of his
     father-in-law, the great duke of Marlborough, whose
     faculties had been for some time greatly impaired. He was
     interred in Westminster-abbey, with such profusion of
     funeral pomp, as evinced the pride and ostentation, much
     more than the taste and concern, of those who directed his
     obsequies. He was succeeded as master of the ordnance, and
     colonel of the first regiment of foot guards, by earl
     Cadogan.

<p class="side">1722</p>
</center>
<p>
In the beginning of May, the king is said to have received from the duke
of Orleans full and certain information of a fresh conspiracy formed
against his person and government. A camp was immediately formed
in Hyde-Park. All military officers were ordered to repair to their
respective commands. Lieutenant-general Macartney was despatched to
Ireland, to bring over some troops from that kingdom. Some suspected
persons were apprehended in Scotland: the states of Holland were desired
to have their auxiliary or guarantee troops in readiness to be embarked;
and colonel Churchill was sent to the court of France with a private
commission. The apprehension raised by this supposed plot affected
the public credit. South-Sea stock began to fall, and crowds of people
called in their money from the bank. Lord Townshend wrote a letter to
the mayor of London, by the king's command, signifying his majesty's
having received unquestionable advices that several of his subjects had
entered into a wicked conspiracy, in concert with traitors abroad, for
raising a rebellion in favour of a popish pretender; but that he was
firmly assured the authors of it neither were nor would be supported
by any foreign power. This letter was immediately answered by an
affectionate address from the court of aldermen; and the example of
London was followed by many other cities and boroughs. The king had
determined to visit Hanover, and actually settled a regency, in which
the prince of Wales was not included: but now this intended journey was
laid aside; the court was removed to Kensington, and the prince retired
to Richmond. The bishop of Rochester having been seized with his
papers, was examined before a committee of the council, who committed
him to the Tower for high-treason. The earl of Orrery, lord North and
Grey, and Mr. Cockran and Mr. Smith from Scotland, and Mr. Christopher
Layer, a young gentleman of the Temple, were confined in the same
place. Mr. George Kelly, an Irish clergyman, Mr. Robert Cotton of
Huntingdonshire, Mr. Bingly, Mr. Fleetwood, Neynoe, an Irish priest, and
several persons, were taken into custody; and Mr. Shippen's house was
searched. After bishop Atterbury had remained a fortnight in the Tower,
sir Constantine Phipps presented a petition to the court at the Old
Bailey, in the name of Mrs. Morris, that prelate's daughter, praying
that, in consideration of the bishop's ill state of health, he might be
either brought to a speedy trial, bailed, or discharged: but this was
over-ruled. The churchmen through the whole kingdom were filled with
indignation at the confinement of a bishop, which they said was an
outrage upon the church of England, and the episcopal order. Far from
concealing their sentiments on this subject, the clergy ventured to
offer up public prayers for his health, in almost all the churches and
chapels of London and Westminster. In the meantime, the king, attended
by the prince of Wales, made a summer progress through the western
counties.

<h2>
    NEW PARLIAMENT.
</h2>
<p>
The new parliament being assembled on the ninth day of October, his
majesty made them acquainted with the nature of the conspiracy. He said
the conspirators had, by their emissaries, made the strongest instances
for succours from foreign powers, but were disappointed in their
expectations. That nevertheless, confiding in their numbers, they had
resolved once more, upon their own strength, to attempt the subversion
of his government. He said they had provided considerable sums of money,
engaged great numbers of officers from abroad, secured large quantities
of arms and ammunition; and, had not the plot been timely discovered,
the whole nation, and particularly the city of London, would have been
involved in blood and confusion. He expatiated upon the mildness and
integrity of his own government; and inveighed against the ingratitude,
the implacability, and madness of the disaffected, concluding with an
assurance that he would steadily adhere to the constitution in church
and state, and continue to make the laws of the realm the rule and
measure of all his actions. Such addresses were presented by both
houses, as the fears and attachment of the majority may be supposed to
have dictated on such an occasion. A bill was brought into the house of
lords for suspending the <i>habeas-corpus</i> act for a whole year, but they
were far from being unanimous in agreeing to such an unusual length of
time. By this suspension they, in effect, vested the ministry with a
dictatorial power over the liberties of the people.

<h2>
    DECLARATION OF THE PRETENDER.
</h2>
<p>
The opposition in the house of commons was so violent, that Mr. Robert
Walpole found it necessary to alarm their apprehensions by a dreadful
story of a design to seize the bank and exchequer, and to proclaim the
pretender on the Royal Exchange. Their passions being inflamed by this
ridiculous artifice, they passed the bill, which immediately received
the royal assent. The duke of Norfolk being brought from Bath, was
examined before the council, and committed to the Tower on suspicion
of high-treason. On the sixteenth day of November, the king sent to the
house of peers the original and printed copy of a declaration signed by
the pretender. It was dated at Lucca, on the twentieth day of September,
in the present year, and appeared to be a proposal addressed to the
subjects of Great Britain and Ireland, as well as to all foreign princes
and states. In this paper, the chevalier de St. George having mentioned
the late violation of the freedom of elections, conspiracies invented to
give a colour to new oppressions, infamous informers, and the state of
proscription in which he supposed every honest man to be, very gravely
proposed, that if king George would relinquish to him the throne of
Great Britain, he would, in return, bestow upon him the title of king
in his native dominions, and invite all Other states to confirm it; he
likewise promised to leave to king George his succession to the British
dominions secure, whenever, in due course, his natural right should take
place. The lords unanimously resolved that this declaration was a false,
insolent, and traitorous libel; and ordered it to be burned at the Royal
Exchange. The commons concurred in these resolutions. Both houses joined
in an address, expressing their utmost astonishment and indignation at
the surprising insolence of the pretender; and assuring his majesty they
were determined to support his title to the crown with their lives and
fortunes. The commons prepared a bill for raising one hundred thousand
pounds upon the real and personal estates of all papists, or persons
educated in the popish religion, towards defraying the expenses
occasioned by the late rebellion and disorders. This bill, though
strenuously opposed by some moderate members as a species of
persecution, was sent up to the house of lords; together with another
obliging all persons being papists in Scotland, and all persons in Great
Britain, refusing or neglecting to take the oaths appointed for the
security of the king's person and government, to register their names
and real estates. Both these bills passed through the upper house
without amendment, and received the royal sanction.

<h2>
    REPORT OF THE SECRET COMMITTEE.
</h2>
<p>
Mr. Layer being brought to his trial at the king's bench, on the
twenty-first day of November, was convicted for having enlisted men for
the pretender's service, in order to stir up a rebellion, and received
sentence of death. He was reprieved for some time, and examined by a
committee of the house of commons: but he either could not, or would
not, discover the particulars of the conspiracy, so that he suffered
death at Tyburn, and his head was fixed up at Temple-bar. Mr. Pulteney,
chairman of the committee, reported to the house, that, from the
examination of Layer and others, a design had been formed by persons of
figure and distinction at home, in conjunction with traitors abroad, for
placing the pretender on the throne of these realms: that their first
intention was to procure a body of foreign troops to invade the kingdom
at the time of the late elections; but that the conspirators being
disappointed in this expectation, resolved to make an attempt at the
time that it was generally believed the king intended to go to Hanover,
by the help of such officers and soldiers as could pass into England
unobserved, from abroad, under the command of the late duke of Ormond,
who was to have landed in the river with a great quantity of arms
provided in Spain for that purpose; at which time the Tower was to have
been seized. That this scheme being also defeated by the vigilance of
the government, they deferred their enterprise till the breaking up of
the camp; and, in the meantime, employed their agents to corrupt and
seduce the officers and soldiers of the army: that it appeared from
several letters and circumstances, that the late duke of Ormond, the
duke of Norfolk, the earl of Orrery, lord North and Grey, and the bishop
of Rochester, were concerned in this conspiracy; that their acting
agents were Christopher Layer and John Plunket, who travelled together
to Rome; Dennis Kelly, George Kelly, and Thomas Carte, nonjuring
clergymen; Neynoe the Irish priest, who by this time was drowned in
the river Thames in attempting to make his escape from the messenger's
house; Mrs. Spilman, alias Yallop, and John Sample.

<h2>
    BILL OF PAINS AND PENALTIES AGAINST THE BISHOP OF ROCHESTER.
</h2>
<p>
This pretended conspiracy, in all likelihood, extended no farther than
the first rudiments of a design that was never digested into any regular
form; otherwise the persons said to be concerned in it must have been
infatuated to a degree of frenzy: for they were charged with having made
application to the regent of France, who was well known to be intimately
connected with the king of Great Britain. The house of commons, however,
resolved, that it was a detestable and horrid conspiracy for raising
a rebellion, seizing the Tower and the city of London, laying violent
hands upon the persons of his most sacred majesty and the prince of
Wales, in order to subvert our present happy establishment in church and
state, by placing a popish pretender upon the throne: that it was formed
and carried on by persons of figure and distinction, and their agents
and instruments, in conjunction with traitors abroad. Bills were brought
in and passed, for inflicting pains and penalties against John Plunket
and George Kelly, who were by these acts to be kept in close custody
during his majesty's pleasure, in any prison in Great Britain; and that
they should not attempt to escape on pain of death, to be inflicted upon
them and their assistants. Mr. Yonge made a motion for a bill of the
same nature against the bishop of Rochester. This was immediately
brought into the house, though sir William Wyndham affirmed that there
was no evidence against him but conjectures and hearsay. The bishop
wrote a letter to the speaker, importing, that, though conscious of his
own innocence, he should decline giving the house any trouble that day,
contenting himself with the opportunity of making his defence before
another, of which he had the honour to be a member. Counsel being heard
for the bill, it was committed to a grand committee on the sixth day of
April, when the majority of the tory members quitted the house. It
was then moved, that the bishop should be deprived of his office
and benefice, and banished the kingdom for ever. Mr. Lawson and Mr.
Oglethorpe spoke in his favour.
</p>
<center>
<p class="side">1723</p>
</center>
<p>
The bill being passed, and sent up to the lords, the bishop was brought
to his trial before them on the ninth of May. Himself and his counsel
having been heard, the lords proceeded to consider the articles of the
bill. When they read it a third time, a motion was made to pass it, and
then a long and warm debate ensued. Earl Paulet demonstrated the danger
and injustice of swerving in such an extraordinary manner from the fixed
rules of evidence. The duke of Wharton having summed up the depositions,
and proved the insufficiency of them, concluded with saying, that, let
the consequences be what they would, he hoped such a hellish stain
would never sully the lustre and glory of that illustrious house, as to
condemn a man without the least evidence. Lord Bathurst spoke
against the bill with equal strength and eloquence. He said, if such
extraordinary proceedings were countenanced, he saw nothing remaining
for him and others to do, but to retire to their country houses,
and there, if possible, quietly enjoy their estates within their own
families, since the least correspondence, the least intercepted letter,
might be made criminal. He observed, that cardinal Mazarin boasted, that
if he had but two lines of any man's writing, he could, by means of a
few circumstances, attested by witnesses, deprive him of his life at
his pleasure. Turning to the bench of bishops, who had been generally
unfavourable to Dr. Atterbury, he said he could hardly account for the
inveterate hatred and malice some persons bore the learned and ingenuous
bishop of Rochester, unless they were intoxicated with the infatuation
of some savage Indians, who believe they inherited not only the spoils,
but even the abilities of any great enemy whom they had killed in
battle. The bill was supported by the duke of Argyle, the earl of
Seafield, and Lord Lechmere, which last was answered by earl Cowper.
This nobleman observed, that the strongest argument urged in behalf of
the bill was necessity; but that, for his part, he saw no necessity that
could justify such unprecedented and such dangerous proceedings, as the
conspiracy had above twelve months before been happily discovered, and
the effects of it prevented: that, besides the intrinsic weight and
strength of the government, the hands of those at the helm had been
still further fortified by the suspension of the <i>habeas-corpus</i> act,
and the additional troops which had been raised. He said the known rules
of evidence, as laid down at first and established by the law of the
land, were the birth-right of every subject in the nation, and ought to
be constantly observed, not only in the inferior courts of judicature,
but also in both houses of parliament, till altered by the legislature;
that the admitting of the precarious and uncertain evidence of the
clerks of the post-office, was a very dangerous precedent. In former
times, said he, it was thought very grievous that in capital cases a
man should be affected by similitude of hands; but here the case is much
worse, since it is allowed that the clerks of the post-office should
carry the similitude of hands four months in their minds. He applauded
the bishop's noble deportment in declining to answer before the house of
commons, whose proceedings in this unprecedented manner, against a
lord of parliament, was such an encroachment on the prerogative of the
peerage, that if they submitted to it, by passing the bill, they
might be termed the last of British peers, for giving up their ancient
privileges. The other party were not so solicitous about answering
reasons, as eager to put the question, when the bill passed, and a
protest was entered. By this act the bishop was deprived of all offices,
benefices, and dignities, and rendered incapable of enjoying any for the
future: he was banished the realm, and subjected to the pains of death
in case he should return, as were all persons who should correspond with
him during his exile. Dr. Friend, the celebrated physician, who was a
member of the house of commons, and had exerted himself strenuously
in behalf of the bishop, was now taken into custody on suspicion of
treasonable practices.

<h2>
    PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THOSE CONCERNED IN THE LOTTERY AT HAMBURGH.
</h2>
<p>
The next object that excited the resentment of the commons was the
scheme of a lottery to be drawn at Hamburgh in the king's German
dominions. The house appointed a committee to inquire into this
and other lotteries at that time on foot in London. The scheme was
published, on pretence of raising a subscription for maintaining a trade
between Great Britain and the king's territories on the Elbe; but it
was a mysterious scene of iniquity, which the committee, with all their
penetration, could not fully discover. They reported, however, that it
was an infamous fraudulent undertaking, whereby many unwary persons had
been drawn in, to their great loss: that the manner of carrying it
on had been a manifest violation of the laws of the kingdom: that the
managers and agents of this lottery had, without any authority for so
doing, made use of his majesty's royal name, thereby to give countenance
to the infamous project, and induce his majesty's subjects to engage or
be concerned therein. A bill was brought in to suppress this lottery;
and to oblige the managers of it to make restitution of the money they
had received from the contributors. At the same time the house resolved,
That John lord viscount Barrington had been notoriously guilty of
promoting, abetting, and carrying on their fraudulent undertaking;
for which offence he should be expelled the house. The court of Vienna
having erected an East-India company at Os-tend, upon a scheme formed by
one Colebrooke an English merchant, sir Nathaniel Gould represented to
the house of commons the great detriment which the English East-India
company had already received, and were likely further to sustain,
by this Ostend company. The house immediately resolved, That for the
subjects of this kingdom to subscribe, or be concerned in encouraging
any subscription, to promote an East-India company now erecting in the
Austrian Netherlands, was a high crime and misdemeanor; and a law
was enacted for preventing British subjects from engaging in that
enterprise. By another act, relating to the South-Sea company, the two
millions of stock which had been annihilated were revived, added to the
capital, and divided among the proprietors. A third law passed, for the
more effectual execution of justice in a part of Southwark called
the Mint, where a great number of debtors had taken sanctuary, on the
supposition that it was a privileged place. On the twenty-seventh clay
of May the session was closed, with a speech that breathed nothing
but panegyric, acknowledgment, and affection to a parliament which had
complied with all his majesty's wishes.

<h2>
    AFFAIRS OF THE CONTINENT.
</h2>
<p>
His majesty having ennobled the son of Mr. Robert Walpole, in
consideration of the father's services, made a good number of church
promotions. He admitted the imprisoned lords and gentlemen to bail;
granted a pardon to lord Bolingbroke; and ordered the bishop of
Rochester to be conveyed to the continent. Then he himself set out for
Hanover, leaving the administration of his kingdoms in the hands of a
regency, lord Har-court being one of the justices. The king was attended
by the two secretaries, lords Townshend and Carteret, who were counted
able negotiators. The affairs of the continent had begun to take a new
turn. The interests and connexions of the different princes were become
perplexed and embarrassed; and king George resolved to unravel them
by dint of negotiation. Understanding that a treaty was on the carpet
between the czar and the king of Sweden, favourable to the duke of
Holstein's pretensions to Sleswick, the possession of which the elector
of Hanover had guaranteed to Denmark, his majesty began to be in pain
for Bremen and Verden. The regent of France and the king of Spain had
now compromised all differences; and their reconciliation was cemented
by a double marriage between Philip's sons and the regent's daughters.
The former proposed new treaties to England; but insisted upon the
restitution of Gibraltar and Port-Mahon, as well as upon the king's
openly declaring against the Ostend company. His Britannic majesty was
apprehensive, that, should the emperor be hard pressed on that subject,
he might join the czar and the king of Sweden, and promote their designs
in favour of the duke of Holstein. On the other hand, all the Italian
powers exclaimed against the treaty of London. The pope had protested
against any thing that might have been decided at Cambray to the
prejudice of his right. Memorials to the same effect had been presented
by the king of Sardinia, the dukes of Tuscany, Parma, and Modena. France
and Spain were inclined to support these potentates against the house
of Austria. Europe seemed to be on the eve of a new war. King George was
entangled in such a variety of treaties and interests, that he knew not
well how to extricate himself from the troublesome engagements he had
contracted. By declaring for the emperor, he must have countenanced the
new establishment at Ostend, which was so prejudicial to his British
subjects, and incurred the resentment of France, Spain, and their allies
of Italy. In renouncing the interest of the emperor, he would have
exposed his German dominions. In vain he exhorted the emperor to relax
in his disputes with Spain, and give up the Ostend company, which was so
detrimental and disagreeable to his faithful allies; the court of Vienna
promised in general to observe the treaties which it had concluded,
but declined entering into any particular discussion; so that all his
majesty's endeavours ended in contracting closer connexions with Prussia
and Denmark. All those negotiations carried on, all those treaties
concluded by king George, with almost every prince and state in
Christendom, which succeeded one another so fast, and appear at first
view so intricate and unaccountable, were founded upon two simple and
natural principles, namely, the desire of ascertaining his acquisitions
as elector of Hanover, and his resolution to secure himself against
the disaffection of his British subjects, as well as the efforts of the
pretender.

<h2>
    CLAMOUR IN IRELAND ON ACCOUNT OF WOOD'S COINAGE.
</h2>
<p>
Great Britain at this period enjoyed profound tranquillity. Ireland was
a little ruffled by an incident which seemed to have been misrepresented
to the people of that kingdom. William Wood had obtained a patent for
furnishing Ireland with copper currency, in which it was deficient.
A great clamour was raised against this coin. The parliament of that
kingdom, which met in September, resolved, that it would be prejudicial
to the revenue, destructive of trade, and of dangerous consequence
to the rights of the subject; that the patent had been obtained by
misrepresentation; that the halfpence wanted weight; that, even if the
terms of the patent had been complied with, there would have been
a great loss to the nation; that granting the power of coinage to a
private person had ever been highly prejudicial to the kingdom, and
would at all times be of dangerous consequence. Addresses from both
houses were presented to the king on this subject. The affair was
referred to the lords of the privy-council of England. They justified
the conduct of the patentee, upon the report of Sir Isaac Newton and
other officers of the Mint, who had made an assay and trial of Wood's
halfpence, and found he had complied with the terms of the patent. They
declared that this currency exceeded in goodness, fineness, and value
of metal, all the copper money which had been coined for Ireland, in the
reigns of king Charles II., king James II., king William and queen Mary.
The privy-council likewise demonstrated, that his majesty's predecessors
had always exercised the undoubted prerogative of granting patents for
copper coinage in Ireland to private persons: that none of these patents
had been so beneficial to the kingdom as this granted to William
Wood, who had not obtained it in an unprecedented manner, but after a
reference to the attorney and solicitor-general, and after Sir Isaac
Newton had been consulted in every particular: finally, they proved, by
a great number of witnesses, that there was a real want of such money in
Ireland. Notwithstanding this decision, the ferment of the Irish nation
was industriously kept up by clamour, pamphlets, papers, and lampoons,
written by dean Swift and other authors; so that Wood voluntarily
reduced his coinage from the value of one hundred thousand to forty
thousand pounds. Thus the noise was silenced. The commons of Ireland
passed an act for accepting the affirmation of the quakers instead of
an oath; and voted three hundred and forty thousand pounds towards
discharging the debt of the nation, which amounted to about double that
sum.

<h2>
    DEATH OF THE DUKE OF ORLEANS.
</h2>
<p>
In the month of October, England lost a worthy nobleman in the death
of earl Cowper, who had twice discharged the office of lord-chancellor,
with equal discernment and integrity. He was profoundly skilled in the
laws of his country; in his apprehension quick and penetrating; in his
judgment clear and determinate. He possessed a manly eloquence; his
manner was agreeable, and his deportment graceful. This year was
likewise remarkable for the death of the duke of Orleans, regent of
France, who, since the decease of Louis XIV., had ruled that nation
with the most absolute authority. He was a prince of taste and spirit,
endowed with shining talents for empire, which he did not fail to
display, even in the midst of effeminate pursuits and idle debauchery.
From the infirm constitution of the infant king, he had conceived hopes
of ascending the throne, and taken his measures accordingly; but the
young monarch's health began to be established, and all the duke's
schemes were defeated by an apoplexy, of which he died, in the
fiftieth year of his age, after having nominated the duke of Bourbon as
prime-minister. King George immediately received assurances of the good
disposition of the French court, to cultivate and even improve the good
understanding so happily established between France and Great Britain.
The king arrived in England on the eighteenth day of December; and on
the ninth day of January the parliament was assembled. His majesty, in
his speech, recommended to the commons the care of the public debts; and
he expressed his satisfaction at seeing the sinking fund improved and
augmented, so as to put the debt of the nation into a method of being
speedily and gradually discharged.

<h2>
    AN ACT FOR LESSENING THE PUBLIC DEBTS.
</h2>
<p>
This was the repeated theory of patriotism, which unhappily for the
subjects, was never reduced to practice; not but that a beginning
of such a laudable work was made in this very session, by an act for
lessening the public debts. This law provided that the annuities at five
per cent, charged on the general fund by a former act, except such as
had been subscribed into the South-Sea, together with the unsubscribed
blanks of the lottery in the year one thousand seven hundred and
fourteen, should be paid off at Lady-day of the year next ensuing, with
the money arising from the sinking fund. The ministry, however, did not
persevere in this path of prudent economy. The commons granted all the
supplies that were demanded. They voted ten thousand seamen; and the
majority, though not without violent opposition, agreed to maintain four
thousand additional troops, which had been raised in the preceding
year; so that the establishment of the land-forces amounted to eighteen
thousand two hundred and sixty-four. The expense of the year was
defrayed by a land-tax and malt-tax. The commons having despatched the
supply, took into consideration a grievance arising from protections
granted by foreign ministers, peers and members of parliament, under
which profligate persons used to screen themselves from the prosecution
of their just creditors. The commons resolved, That all protections
granted by members of that house should be declared void, and
immediately withdrawn. The lords made a declaration to the same purpose,
with an exception to menial servants, and those necessarily employed
about the estates of peers.*

    PHILIP, KING OF SPAIN, ABDICATES THE THRONE.

<p>
In the beginning of this year, Philip king of Spain, retiring with his
queen to the monastery of St. Ildefonso, sent the marquis of Grimaldi,
his principal secretary of state, to his son Louis prince of Asturias,
with a solemn renunciation of the crown, and a letter of advice in
which he exhorted him to cultivate the Blessed Virgin with the warmest
devotion, and put himself and his kingdoms under her protection. The
renunciation was published through the whole monarchy of Spain; and
the council of Castile resolved, That Louis might assume the reins of
government without assembling the Cortez. The English minister at Paris
was instructed to interpose in behalf of the French protestants, against
whom a severe edict had been lately published; but his remonstrances
produced no effect. England, in the meantime, was quite barren of such
events as deserve a place in history. The government was now firmly
established on the neck of opposition; and commerce flourished even
under the load of grievous impositions.

<h2>
    ABUSES IN CHANCERY.
</h2>
<p>
The next parliament, which met on the twelfth day of November, seemed
to be assembled for no other purpose than that of establishing funds for
the expense of the ensuing year; yet the session was distinguished by
a remarkable incident&mdash;namely, the trial of the earl of Macclesfield,
lord-chancellor of England. This nobleman had connived at certain
venal practices touching the sale of places, and the money of suitors
deposited with the masters of chancery, so as to incur the general
reproach of the nation. He found it necessary to resign the great seal
in the beginning of January, 1725. On the ninth day of the ensuing
month, the king sent a message to the commons, importing, That his
majesty having reason to apprehend that the suitors in the court of
chancery were in danger of losing a considerable sum of money, from
the insufficiency of some of the masters, thought himself obliged, in
justice and compassion to the said sufferers, to take the most speedy
and proper method the law would allow for inquiring into the state of
the master's accounts, and securing their effects for the benefit of the
suitors; and his majesty having had several reports laid before him, in
pursuance of the directions he had given, had ordered the reports to be
communicated to the house, that they might have as full and as perfect
a view of this important affair as the shortness of the time, and the
circumstances and nature of the proceedings, would admit.

<h2>
    TRIAL OF THE EARL OF MACCLESFIELD.
</h2>
<p>
These papers being taken into consideration, sir George Oxenden
observed, that enormous abuses had crept into the high court of
chancery; that the crimes and misdemeanors of the late lord-chancellor
were many and various, but might be reduced to the following heads
&mdash;that he had embezzled the estates and effects of many widows, orphans,
and lunatics; that he had raised the offices of masters in chancery
to an exorbitant price; trusting in their hands large sums of money
belonging to suitors, that they might be enabled to comply with his
exorbitant demands, and that in several cases he had made divers
irregular orders. He therefore moved, That Thomas earl of Macclesfield
should be impeached of high crimes and misdemeanors. Mr. Pulteney
moved, That this affair might be left to the consideration of a select
committee. Sir William Wyndham asserted, That in proceeding by way
of impeachment upon reports from above, they would make a dangerous
precedent; and seem to give up the most valuable of their privileges,
the inquest after state criminals. The question being put, it was
carried for the impeachment. The earl was accordingly impeached at the
bar of the upper house; a committee was appointed to prepare articles;
and a bill was brought in, to indemnify the masters in chancery from the
penalties of the law, upon discovering what consideration they had paid
for their admission to their respective offices. The trial lasted twenty
days; the earl was convicted of fradulent practices; and condemned in a
fine of thirty thousand pounds, with imprisonment until that sum should
be paid. He was immediately committed to the Tower, where he continued
about six weeks; but upon producing the money he was discharged; and sir
Peter King, now created baron of Oakham, succeeded him in the office of
chancellor.

<h2>
    DEBATES ABOUT THE DEBTS OF THE CIVIL LIST.
</h2>
<p>
His majesty, on the eighth day of April, gave the house of commons to
understand, that having been engaged in some extraordinary expenses, he
hoped he should be enabled to raise a sum of money, by making use of the
funds lately established for the payment of the civil list annuities,
in order to discharge the debts contracted in the civil government.
Mr. Pulteney, cofferer of the household, moved for an address, That an
account should be laid before the house of all monies paid for secret
service, pensions, and bounties, from the twenty-fifth day of March, in
the year one thousand seven hundred and one, to the twenty-fifth of the
same month in the present year. This address being voted, a motion
was made to consider the king's message. Mr. Pulteney urged, that this
consideration should be postponed until the house should have examined
the papers that were the subject of the address. He expressed his
surprise that a debt amounting to above five hundred thousand pounds
should be contracted in three years; he said, he did not wonder that
some persons should be so eager to make good the deficiencies of the
civil-list, since they and their friends enjoyed such a share of that
revenue; and he desired to know whether this was all that was due, or
whether they should expect another reckoning? This gentleman began to
be dissatisfied with the measures of the ministry; and his sarcasms
were aimed at Mr. Walpole, who undertook to answer his objections. The
commons took the message into consideration, and passed a bill, enabling
his majesty to raise a sum, not exceeding one million, by exchequer
bills, loans, or otherwise, on the credit of the deductions of sixpence
per pound, directed by an act of parliament of the seventh year of his
majesty, and of the civil-list revenues, at an interest not exceeding
three pounds per cent, till repayment of the principal.

    BILL IN FAVOUR OF THE LATE LORD BOLINGBROKE.
</h2>
<p>
On the twentieth day of April, a petition was presented to the house
by lord Finch in behalf of Henry St. John, late viscount Bolingbroke,
praying that the execution of the law with respect to his forfeitures
might be suspended, as a pardon had suspended it with respect to his
life. Mr. Walpole signified to the house, by his majesty's command,
that, seven years before, the petitioner had made humble application
and submission to the king, with assurances of duty, allegiance, and
fidelity; that, from his behaviour since that time, his majesty was
convinced of his being a fit object of his mercy, and consented to his
petitioning the house. The petition being read, Mr. Walpole declared
himself fully satisfied that the petitioner had sufficiently atoned for
his past offences; and therefore deserved the favour of that house, so
far as to enable him to enjoy the family inheritance that was settled
upon him, which he could not do by virtue of his majesty's pardon,
without an act of parliament. Lord Finch moved, That a bill might be
brought in for this purpose, and was warmly opposed by Mr. Methuen,
comptroller of the household, who represented Bolingbroke as a monster
of iniquity. His remonstrance was supported by lord William Paulet and
Mr. Onslow; nevertheless, the bill was prepared, passed through both
houses, and received the royal assent. An act being passed for disarming
the highlanders of Scotland, another for regulating elections within
the city of London, a third for reducing the interest of several bank
annuities, together with some bills of a private nature, the parliament
was prorogued in May, after the king had, in the warmest terms of
acknowledgment, expressed his approbation of their conduct. Then he
appointed lords-justices to govern the nation in his absence; and set
out in June for his German dominions.*

<h2>
    TREATY OF ALLIANCE.
</h2>
<p>
The tide of political interest on the continent had begun to flow in a
new channel, so as to render ineffectual the mounds which his Britannic
majesty had raised by his multiplicity of negotiations. Louis, the
Spanish monarch, dying soon after his elevation to the throne, his
father Philip resumed the crown which he had resigned, and gave himself
up implicitly to the conduct of his queen, who was a princess of
indefatigable intrigue and insatiate ambition. The infanta, who had been
married to Louis XV. of France, was so disagreeable to her husband,
that the whole French nation began to be apprehensive of a civil war in
consequence of his dying without male issue; he therefore determined,
with the advice of his council, to send back the infanta, as the
nuptials had not been consummated; and she was attended to Madrid by the
marquis de. Monteleone. The queen of Spain resented this insult offered
to her daughter; and, in revenge, dismissed mademoiselle de Beaujolois,
one of the regent's daughters, who had been betrothed to her son don
Carlos. As the congress at Cambray had proved ineffectual, she offered
to adjust her differences with the emperor, under the sole mediation
of Great Britain. This was an honour which king George declined. He was
averse to any undertaking that might interrupt the harmony subsisting
between him and the court of Versailles; and he had taken umbrage at the
emperor's refusing to grant the investiture of Bremen and Verden except
upon terms which he did not choose to embrace. The peace between the
courts of Vienna and Madrid, which he refused to mediate, was effected
by a private negotiation, under the management of the duke de Ripperda,
a native of the states-general, who had renounced the protestant
religion, and entered into the service of his catholic majesty. By
two treaties, signed at Vienna in the month of April, the emperor
acknowledged Philip as king of Spain and the Indies, promised that he
would not molest him in the possession of those dominions that
were secured to him by the treaty of Utrecht. Philip renounced all
pretensions to the dominions in Italy and the Netherlands, adjudged to
the emperor by the treaty of London; Charles granted the investiture of
the dukedoms of Tuscany, Parma, and Placentia, to the eldest son of
the queen of Spain, in default of heirs in the present possessors, as
masculine fiefs of the empire. Spain became guarantee of the Austrian
succession, according to the pragmatic sanction, by which the dominions
of that house were settled on the emperors's heirs general, and declared
to be a perpetual, indivisible, and inseparable feoffment of the
primogeniture. By the commercial treaty of Vienna, the Austrian subjects
were entitled to advantages in trade with Spain, which no other nation
enjoyed. His catholic majesty guaranteed the Ostend East India company;
and agreed to pay an annual subsidy of four millions of piastres to the
emperor. Great sums were remitted to Vienna; the Imperial forces were
augmented to a formidable number; and other powers were solicited to
engage in this alliance, to which the court of Petersburgh actually
acceded.

<div style="height: 4em;"><br><br><br><br></div>

<h2>
    TREATY OF HANOVER.
</h2>
<p>
The kind of Great Britain took the alarm. The emperor and he had for
some time treated each other with manifest coolness. He had reason to
fear some attempts upon his German dominions, and projected a defensive
treaty with France and Prussia. This alliance, limited to the term of
fifteen years, was negotiated and concluded at Hanover in the month of
September. It implied a mutual guarantee of the dominions possessed by
the contracting parties, their rights and privileges, those of commerce
in particular, and an engagement to procure satisfaction to the
protestants of Thorn, who had lately been oppressed by the catholics,
contrary to the treaty of Oliva. The king having taken these precautions
at Hanover, set out on his return for England; embarked at Helvoetsluys
in the middle of December; and after having been exposed to the fury of
a dreadful storm, was landed with great difficulty at Rye, from whence
he proceeded by land to London. The parliament meeting on the twentieth
day of the next month, he gave them to understand that the distressed
condition of some of their protestant brethren abroad, and the
negotiations and engagements contracted by some foreign powers, which
seemed to have laid the foundation of new troubles and disturbances in
Europe, and to threaten his subjects with the loss of several of the
most advantageous branches of their trade, had obliged him to concert
with other powers such measures as might give a check to the ambitious
views of those who were endeavouring to render themselves formidable,
and put a stop to the further progress of such dangerous designs. He
told them that the enemies of his government were already very busy, by
their instruments and emissaries in those courts whose measures seemed
most to favour their purposes, in soliciting and promoting the cause of
the pretender. One sees, at first sight, that the interests of Germany
dictated the treaty of Hanover; but, in order to secure the approbation
of Great Britain, upon which the support of this alliance chiefly
depended, it was judged necessary to insert the articles relating to
commerce and the protestant religion, as if the engagement had been
contracted purely for the advantage and glory of England. In a word, the
ministry began now to ring the changes upon a few words that have been
repeated ever since, like cabalistical sounds, by which the nation has
been enchanted into a very dangerous connexion with the concerns of the
continent. They harangued, they insisted upon the machinations of the
disaffected, the designs of a popish pretender, the protestant interest,
and the balance of power, until these expressions became absolutely
terms of ridicule with every person of common sense and reflection. The
people were told that the emperor and the king of Spain, exclusive
of the public treaties concluded at Vienna, had entered into private
engagements, importing that the Imperialists should join the Spaniards
in recovering Gibraltar and Port-Mahon by force of arms, in case the
king of England should refuse to restore them amicably, according to
a solemn promise he had made: that a double marriage should take place
between the two infants of Spain, and the two archduchesses of Austria;
and that means should be taken to place the pretender on the throne of
Great Britain.
</p>
<p>
When the treaties of Vienna and Hanover fell under consideration of the
house of commons, Horatio Walpole, afterwards termed in derision,
"the balance master," opened the debate with a long unanimated oration,
giving a detail of the affairs of Europe since the treaty of Utrecht. He
enumerated the barrier-treaty, the convention for executing that
treaty, the defensive alliance with the emperor, the other with the most
christian king and the states-general, another convention, the quadruple
alliance, the congress at Cambray, the treaty of Hanover, and that of
Vienna. He explained the nature of each engagement. He said the main
design of the treaty of commerce concluded between the emperor and the
king of Spain, was to countenance and support the East-India company
established at Ostend, which interfered so essentially with the
East-India companies of England and Holland, and was directly contrary
to several solemn treaties still in force. He enlarged upon the danger
to which the balance of power would be exposed, should the issue male
of this projected marriage between the houses of Austria and Spain ever
possess the imperial dignity and the kingdom of Spain together.
The reader will take notice that this very man was one of those who
exclaimed against that article of the treaty of Utrecht, which prevented
the power of those two houses from being immediately united in the
person of the emperor. He did not forget to expatiate upon the pretended
secret engagement concerning Gibraltar and Minorca, and the king's pious
concern for the distressed protestants of Thorn in Poland. In vain did
Mr. Shippen urge that the treaty of Hanover would engage the British
nation in a war for the defence of the king's German dominions, contrary
to an express provision made in the act of limitation. These arguments
had lost all weight. The opposition was so inconsiderable, that the
ministry had no reason to be in pain about any measure they should
propose. An address was voted and delivered to his majesty, approving
the alliance he had concluded at Hanover, in order to obviate and
disappoint the dangerous views and consequences of the treaty of peace
betwixt the emperor and the king of Spain: and promising to support his
majesty against all insults and attacks that should be made upon any of
his territories, though not belonging to the crown of Great Britain. An
address of the same kind was presented by the house of lords in a body.
A bill was brought in, empowering the commissioners of the treasury
to compound with Mr. Richard Hampden, late treasurer of the navy, for a
debt he owed to the crown, amounting to eight-and-forty thousand pounds.
This deficiency was occasioned by his embarking in the South-Sea scheme.
The king recommended his petition; and the house complied with his
request, in consideration of his great-grandfather, the famous John
Hampden, who made such a noble stand against the arbitrary measures of
the first Charles.

<center>
RIOTS IN SCOTLAND.
</center>
<p>
The malt-tax was found so grievous to Scotland, that the people refused
to pay it, and riots were excited in different parts of the kingdom. At
Glasgow, the populace, armed with clubs and staves, rifled the house of
Daniel Campbell, their representative in parliament, who had voted for
the bill, and maltreated some excisemen who attempted to take an account
of the malt. General Wade, who commanded the forces in Scotland, had
sent two companies of soldiers, under the command of captain Bushel,
to prevent or appease a disturbance of this nature. That officer drew
up his men in the street, where they were pelted with stones by the
multitude, which he endeavoured to disperse by firing among them without
shot. This expedient failing, he ordered his men to load their pieces
with ball, and at a time when the magistrates were advancing towards him
in a body, to assist him with their advice and influence, he commanded
the soldiers to fire four different ways, without the sanction of the
civil authority. About twenty persons were killed or wounded on this
occasion. The people seeing so many victims fall, were exasperated
beyond all sense of danger. They began to procure arms, and breathed
nothing but defiance and revenge. Bushel thought proper to retreat to
the castle of Dumbarton, and was pursued above five miles hy the enraged
multitude. General Wade being informed of this transaction, assembled a
body of forces; and being accompanied by Duncan Forbes, lord-advocate,
took possession of Glasgow. The magistrates were apprehended and
conveyed prisoners to Edinburgh, where the lords justiciary having taken
cognizance of the affair, declared them innocent; so that they were
immediately discharged. Bushel was tried for murder, convicted, and
condemned; but instead of undergoing the penalties of the law, he was
indulged with a pardon, and promoted in the service. Daniel Campbell
having petitioned the house of commons, that he might be indemnified
for the damage he had sustained from the rioters, a bill passed in his
favour, granting him a certain sum to be raised from an imposition laid
upon all the beer and ale brewed in the city of Glasgow. The malt-tax
was so sensibly felt in Scotland, that the convention of the royal
burghs presented a remonstrance against it, as a grievous burden,
which their country could not bear: petitions to the same purpose were
delivered to the commons from from different shires in that kingdom.
</p>
<center>
<p class="side">1726</p>
</center>
<p>
On the twenty-fourth day of March, the king sent a message to the house
by sir Paul Methuen, desiring an extraordinary supply, that he might be
able to augment his maritime force, and concert such other measures as
should be necessary in the present conjuncture. A debate ensued, but
the majority complied with the demand. Some members in the upper house
complained that the message was not sent to both houses of parliament,
and this suggestion gave rise to another debate, in which lord
Bathurst and others made some melancholy reflections upon the state of
insignificance to which the peers of England were reduced. Such remarks,
however, were very little minded by the ministry, who had obtained
a complete victory over all opposition. The supplies, ordinary and
extraordinary, being granted, with every thing else which the court
thought proper to ask, and several bills passed for the regulation of
civil economy, the king dismissed the parliament on the twenty-fourth
day of May.

<h2>
    A SQUADRON SENT TO THE BALTIC.
</h2>
<p>
By this time Peter the czar of Muscovy was dead, and his empress
Catharine had succeeded him on the Russian throne. This princess had
begun to assemble forces in the neighbourhood of Petersburgh, and to
prepare a formidable armament for a naval expedition. King George,
concluding that her design was against Sweden, sent a strong squadron
into the Baltic, under the command of sir Charles Wager, in order to
anticipate her views upon his allies. The English fleet being joined
at Copenhagen by a Danish squadron, alarmed the court of Russia, which
immediately issued orders for reinforcing the garrisons of Wilbourg,
Cronstadt, Revel, and Riga. The English admiral, having had an audience
with his Swedish majesty, steered towards Revel, and sent thither a
lieutenant, with a letter from the king of Great Britain to the czarina.
This was an expostulation, in which his majesty observed, that he and
his allies could not fail of being alarmed at her great preparations by
sea and land. He complained that measures had been taken at her court in
favour of the pretender; that his repeated instances for establishing
a lasting friendship with the crown of Russia had been treated with
neglect; and he gave her to understand, that he had ordered his admiral
to prevent her ships from coming out of her harbours, should she persist
in her resolution to execute the designs she had projected. The czarina,
in her answer to the king, expressed her surprise that she had not
received his majesty's letter until his fleet was at anchor before
Revel, since it would have been more agreeable to the custom established
among sovereigns, and to the amity which had so long subsisted between
her kingdoms and the crown of Great Britain, to expostulate with her on
her armament, and expected her answer before he had proceeded to such
an offensive measure. She assured him that nothing was farther from her
thoughts than any design to disturb the peace of the North; and with
regard to the pretender, it was a frivolous and stale accusation, which
had been frequently used as a pretext to cover all the unkind steps
lately undertaken against the Russian empire. Sir Charles Wager
continued in his station until he received certain intelligence that the
Russian galleys were laid up in their winter harbour; then he set sail
for the coast of Denmark, from whence he returned to England in the
month of November.

<h2>
    ADMIRAL HOSIER'S EXPEDITION.
</h2>
<p>
King George, that he might not seem to convert all his attention to the
affairs of the North, had equipped two other squadrons, one of which was
destined for the West Indies, under the command of admiral Hosier:
the other, conducted by sir John Jennings, having on board a body of
land-forces, sailed from St. Helen's on the twentieth day of July,
entered the bay of St. Antonio, then visited Lisbon, from whence he
directed his course to the bay of Bulls near Cadiz, and cruised off
Cape St. Mary's, so as to alarm the coast of Spain and fill Madrid with
consternation. Yet he committed no act of hostility: but was treated
with great civility by the Spanish governor of Cadiz, who supplied him
with refreshments. Rear-admiral Hosier, with seven ships of war, had
sailed in April for the Spanish West-Indies, with instructions to block
up the galleons in the port of that country; or should they presume to
come out, to seize and bring them to England. Before his arrival at the
Bastimentos, near Porto-Bello, the treasure, consisting of above six
millions sterling, had been unloaded and carried back to Panama, in
pursuance of an order sent by an advice-boat which had the start of
Hosier. This admiral lay inactive on that station, until he became the
jest of the Spaniards. He returned to Jamaica, where he found means to
reinforce his crews; then he stood over to Carthagena. The Spaniards
had by this time seized the English South-Sea ship at La Vera Cruz,
together with all the vessels and effects belonging to that company.
Hosier in vain demanded restitution: he took some Spanish ships by way
of reprisal, and continued cruising in those seas until the greater
part of his men perished deplorably by the diseases of that unhealthy
climate, and his ships were totally rained by the worms. This brave
officer, being restricted by his orders from obeying the dictates of
his courage, seeing his best officers and men daily swept off by an
outrageous distemper, and his ships exposed to inevitable destruction,
is said to have died of a broken heart; while the people of England
loudly clamoured against this unfortunate expedition, in which so many
lives were thrown away, and so much money expended, without the least
advantage to the nation. It seems to have been a mean piratical scheme
to rob the court of Spain of its expected treasure, even while a peace
subsisted between the two nations. The ministry of Great Britain indeed
alleged, that the Spanish king had entered into engagements in favour of
the pretender.

<h2>
    DISGRACE OF THE DUKE DE RIPPERDA.
</h2>
<p>
The dukes of Ormond and Wharton,* and the earl Marischal, were certainly
at Madrid; and the duke de Ripperda, now prime-minister of Spain,
dropped some expressions to the English envoy that implied some such
design, which however the court of Madrid positively denied.
</p>
<pre>
     * The duke of Wharton having consumed his fortune in riot
     and extravagance, repaired to the court of Vienna, from
     whence he proceeded to Rome, and offered his service to the
     pretender. There he received the order of the garter, and
     the title of duke of Northumberland. He was sent by the
     chevalier de St. George with credentials to the court of
     Madrid, where he abjured the protestant religion, married a
     lady of the queen of Spain's bed-chamber, and obtained the
     rank and appointment of a lieutenant-colonel in the Spanish
     service.
</pre>
<p>
Ripperda, as a foreigner, fell a sacrifice to the jealousy of the
Spanish ministers. He was suddenly dismissed from his employments, with
a pension of three thousand pistoles. He forthwith took refuge in
the house of Vandermeer the Dutch ambassador, who was unwilling to be
troubled with such a guest. He therefore conveyed the duke in his coach
to the house of colonel Stanhope, the British minister, whose protection
he craved and obtained. Nevertheless, he was dragged from thence by
force, and committed prisoner to the castle of Segovia. He afterwards
made his escape, and sheltered himself in England from the resentment of
his catholic majesty. Colonel Stanhope complained of this violation of
the law of nations, which the Spanish ministers endeavoured to excuse.
Memorials and letters passed between the two courts, and every thing
tended to a rupture. The king of Spain purchased ships of war; began to
make preparations for some important undertaking; and assembled an army
of twenty thousand men at St. Roch, on pretence of rebuilding the old
castle of Gibraltar. Meanwhile the states-general and the king of Sweden
acceded to the treaty of Hanover: but the king of Prussia, though his
majesty's son-in-law, was detached from the alliance by the emperor,
with whom he contracted new engagements.

<h2>
    SUBSTANCE OF THE KING'S SPEECH.
</h2>
<p>
On the seventeenth day of January, the British parliament was opened
with a long elaborate speech, importing that the proceedings and
transactions of the emperor and king of Spain, and the secret offensive
alliance concluded between them, had laid the foundation of a most
exorbitant and formidable power; that they were directly levelled
against the most valuable and darling interests and privileges of
the British nation, which must either give up Gibraltar to Spain, and
acquiesce in the emperor's usurped exercise of commerce, or resolve
vigorously to defend their undoubted rights against those reciprocal
engagements, contracted in defiance and violation of all national faith,
and the most solemn treaties. He assured them, that one of those secret
articles was the placing the pretender on the throne of Great Britain;
and another the conquest of Gibraltar and Port Mahon. He affirmed that
those combinations extended themselves into Russia; and that the English
fleet seasonably prevented such designs as would have opened a way to
the invasion of these kingdoms. He exhorted the commons to grant such
supplies as should be necessary for the defence of then-country, and for
making good his engagements with the allies of Great Britain. He told
them that the king of Spain had ordered his minister residing in England
to quit the kingdom; and that he had left a memorial little short of a
declaration, in which he insisted upon the restitution of Gibraltar.
He did not fail to touch the energetic strings which always moved their
passions: the balance of power in Europe, the security of the British
commerce, the designs of a popish pretender, the present happy
establishment, the religion, liberties, and properties of a protestant
people. Such addresses of thanks were penned in both houses as the
ministers were pleased to dictate; yet not without opposition from a
minority, which was far from being formidable, though headed by chiefs
of uncommon talents and resolution. The commons voted twenty thousand
seamen, besides six-and-twenty thousand three hundred and eighty-three
men for the land service; and, to defray the extraordinary expense, a
land-tax of four shillings in the pound was granted.

<h2>
    DEBATE IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS.
</h2>
<p>
The house of lords having taken into consideration the letters and
memorials between the ministers of Great Britain, France, and Spain, and
the papers relating to the accession of the states-general to the treaty
of Hanover, a warm debate ensued. Lord Bathurst took notice that the
accession of the states-general to the treaty was upon condition that
this their act should be approved and ratified by the king of Great
Britain, the most christian king, and the king of Prussia; but that
the minister of his Prussian majesty had refused to sign the act of
accession, which was therefore of no effect: that if the court of France
should, for the same reason, think itself disengaged from the Hanover
alliance, Britain alone would be obliged to bear the burden of an
expensive war against two of the greatest potentates of Europe. He said
he could not see any just reason for a rupture with Spain; that indeed
the duke de Ripperda might have dropped some indiscreet expressions;
he was known to be a man of violent temper; and he had been solemnly
disavowed by his catholic majesty; that, in the memorial left by the
Spanish ambassador, he imputed the violent state of affairs between the
two crowns to the ministers of England; and mentioned a positive promise
made by the king of Great Britain for the restitution of Gibraltar; that
methods of accommodation might be tried before the kingdom engaged in a
war which must be attended with dangerous consequences; that the nation
was loaded with a debt of fifty millions; and, in order to maintain such
a war, would be obliged to raise seven millions yearly; an annual sum
by which the people would soon be exhausted. He observed, that in some
papers laid before the house, mention was made of great sums distributed
in divers places, to bring certain measures to bear. He declared, that
for his own part, he had touched neither Spanish nor English gold; he
was neither a Spaniard nor a Frenchman, but a true Englishman, and so
long as he had the honour to sit in that house, he would speak and
act for the good of his country. He therefore desired their lordships
seriously to consider the matter before them, which was of the last
consequence and importance to the whole nation. He said nothing could be
gained by the war, should it prove successful: and every thing would be
lost should it be unprosperous. He was answered by lord Town-shend, Who
affirmed that his majesty had received positive and certain information
with respect to the secret article of alliance between the courts of
Vienna and Madrid, in favour of the pretender, though the safety of the
state did not permit him to lay these advices before the parliament.
After much altercation, the majority resolved, that the measures his
majesty had thought fit to take were honourable, just, and necessary
for preventing the execution of the dangerous engagement entered into in
favour of the pretender; for preserving the dominions belonging to the
crown of Great Britain by solemn treaties, and particularly those of
Gibraltar and the island of Minorca; and for maintaining to his people
their most valuable rights and privileges of commerce, and the peace and
tranquillity of Europe. Seventeen lords entered a protest against this
resolution. Disputes of the same nature arose from the same subject in
the lower house. Lord Townshend had affirmed in the house of peers,
that no promise of restoring Gibraltar bad been made: sir Kobert Walpole
owned such a promise in the house of commons: a motion was made for
an address, desiring these engagements might be laid before the house;
another member moved for a copy of the memorial presented by Mr. Pointz
to the king of Sweden, and for the secret offensive article between the
courts of Vienna and Madrid; a third motion was made to address the king
for such memorials and representations from the courts of Sweden and
Denmark, as induced him, in the course of the preceding year, to send
a squadron to the Baltic. In the account of the money granted for
the service of the last year, there was an article of one hundred and
twenty-five thousand pounds charged in general terms as issued out for
other engagements and expenses, over and above such as were specified.
Mr. Pulteney moved for an address on this subject; but each of these
motions was rejected on a division: and the majority concurred in an
address of thanks to his majesty, for the great wisdom of his conduct.
They expressed the most implicit confidence in his goodness and
discretion: they promised to support him in all such further measures as
he should find necessary and expedient for preventing a rupture, as well
as for consulting the honour and advantage of these kingdoms.
</p>
<p>
His majesty's speech gave such umbrage to the court of Vienna, that Mr.
Palms, the Imperial resident at London, was ordered to present a warm
memorial to the king, and afterwards to publish it to the whole nation.
In this bold remonstrance, the king was charged with having declared
from the throne, as certain and undoubted facts, several things that
were either wrested, misrepresented, or void of all foundation. The
memorialist affirmed, that the treaty of Vienna was built on the
quadruple alliance; that the treaty of commerce was calculated to
promote the mutual and lawful advantages of the subjects of both
parties, agreeably to the law of nations; and in no respect prejudicial
to the British nation. He declared that there was no offensive alliance
concluded between the two crowns; that the supposed article relating
to the pretender was an absolute falsehood; that the insinuation with
respect to the siege of Gibraltar was equally untrue, his master having
made no engagements with the king of Spain, but such as were specified
in the treaty communicated to his Britannic majesty. He said, however,
the hostilities notoriously committed in the West Indies, and elsewhere,
against the king of Spain, in violation of treaties, seemed to justify
that prince's undertaking the siege of Gibraltar. Finally, he demanded,
in the name of his Imperial majesty, suitable reparation for the injury
his honour had sustained from such calumnious imputations. Both houses
of parliament expressed their indignation at the insolence of this
memorial, in an address to his majesty; and Mr. Palms was ordered
to depart the kingdom. Virulent declarations were presented by the
ministers of the emperor and the king of Great Britain to the diet of
the empire at Ratisbon; and such personal reflections retorted between
these two potentates, that all hope of reconciliation vanished.

<h2>
    CONVENTIONS WITH SWEDEN AND HESSE-CASSEL.
</h2>
<p>
King George, in order to secure himself against the impending storm,
entered into more strict engagements with the French king; and agreed
to pay fifty thousand pounds for three years to the king of Sweden,
in consideration of that prince's holding in readiness a body of ten
thousand troops for the occasions of the alliance. He concluded a fresh
treaty with the king of Denmark, who promised to furnish a certain
number of auxiliaries, on account of a large subsidy granted by the king
of France. The proportions of troops to be sent into the field in
case of a rupture were ascertained. His Britannic majesty engaged for
four-and-twenty thousand men, and a strong squadron to be sent into
the Baltic. He made a convention with the prince of Hesse-Cassel, who
undertook to provide eight thousand infantry, and four thousand horse,
in consideration of seventy-four thousand pounds, to be paid by Great
Britain immediately, and fifty thousand pounds more in case the troops
should bo required, besides their pay and subsistence. Such was the
fruit of all the alliances so industriously planned since the accession
of king George to the throne of Great Britain. In the day of his
trouble the king of Prussia, who had espoused his daughter, deserted his
interest; and the states-general stood aloof. For the security of his
German dominions, he had recourse to the king of France, who was
a precarious ally; to the kings of Sweden and Denmark, and the
principality of Hesse-Cassel: but none of these powers would contribute
their assistance without being gratified with exorbitant subsidies,
though the danger was common, and the efforts ought to have been equal.
Instead of allies, they professed themselves mercenaries. Great Britain
paid them for the defence of their own dominions: she, moreover,
undertook to maintain a powerful fleet for their safety. Is there any
Britain so weak as to think, or so fool-hardy as to affirm, that this
was a British quarrel?

<h2>
    VOTE OF CREDIT.
</h2>
<p>
For the support of those expensive treaties, Mr. Scroope, secretary of
the treasury, moved in the house of commons, that in the malt-tax bill
they should insert a clause of appropriation, empowering the king to
apply such sums as should be necessary for defraying the expenses and
engagements which had been, or should be made before the twenty-fifth
day of September, in concerting such measures as he should think most
conducive to the security of trade, and restoring the peace of Europe.
To little purpose did the members in the opposition urge that this
method of asking and granting supplies was unparliamentary; that such a
clause would render ineffectual that appropriation of the public money,
which the wisdom of all parliaments had thought a necessary security
against misapplication, which was the more to be feared as no provision
was made to call any person to account for the money that should be
disposed of by virtue of this clause; that great sums had already been
granted; that such an unlimited power ought never to be given in a
free government; that such confidence in the crown might, through
the influence of evil ministers, be attended with the most dangerous
consequences; that the constitution could not be preserved, but by a
strict adherence to those essential parliamentary forms of granting
supplies upon estimates, and of appropriating these supplies to services
and occasions publicly avowed and judged necessary; that such clauses,
if not seasonably checked, would become so frequent as in time to lodge
in the crown and in the ministers an absolute and uncontrollable power
of raising money upon the people, which by the constitution is, and
with safety can only be, lodged in the whole legislature. The motion was
carried, the clause added, and the bill passed through the other house
without amendment, though not without opposition. Notwithstanding this
vote of credit, sir William Yonge moved, that towards the supply granted
to the king, the sum of three hundred and seventy thousand pounds should
be raised by loans on exchequer bills, to be charged on the surplus of
the duties on coal and culm, which was reserved for the parliament's
disposal. Though this motion was vigorously opposed by sir Joseph Jekyll
and Mr. Pulteney, as a dangerous deviation from several votes and
acts of parliament, by which the exceed-ings of the public funds were
appropriated to the discharge of the national debt, or to the increase
of the sinking fund, it was carried by the majority.

<h2>
    SIEGE OF GIBRALTAR
</h2>
<p>
On the fifteenth day of May the parliament was prorogued, after the king
had acknowledged their zeal, liberality, and despatch; and given them to
understand that the siege of Gibraltar was actually begun. The trenches
were opened before this fortress on the eleventh day of February, by the
Conde de las Torres, at the head of twenty thousand men. The place
was well provided for a defence; and the old earl of Portmore, who was
governor, embarked with a reinforcement from England, under convoy of
a fleet commanded by sir Charles Wager. He arrived at Gibraltar in the
beginning of April, where he landed the troops, with a great quantity of
ammunition, warlike stores, and four-and-twenty pieces of cannon. At the
same time, five hundred men arrived from Minorca; so that the garrison
amounted to six thousand, plentifully supplied with fresh provisions
from the coast of Barbary, and treated the efforts of the besiegers with
great contempt. The states-general, being apprehensive of an attempt
upon their barrier in the Netherlands, desired the king would hold in
readiness the ten thousand auxiliaries stipulated in the treaty. These
were immediately prepared for embarkation, and the forces of England
were augmented with thirty new raised companies. Sir John Norris set
sail with a powerful fleet for the Baltic, and was joined by a Danish
squadron; but the czarina dying on the seventeenth day of May, he had no
occasion to commit hostilities, as the Russian armament was laid aside.

<h2>
    PRELIMINARIES OF PEACE.
</h2>
<p>
Meanwhile the powers at variance, though extremely irritated against
each other, were all equally averse to a war that might again embroil
all Europe. The king of France interposed his mediation, which was
conducted by the duke de Richlieu, his ambassador at Vienna. Plans and
counterplans of pacification were proposed between the two crowns and
the allies. At length all parties agreed to twelve preliminary articles
which were signed in May at Paris, by the ministers of the Hanoverian
alliance, and afterwards at Vienna, by the Imperial and Spanish
ambassadors. These imported, that hostilities should immediately cease;
that the charter of the Ostend company should be suspended for
seven years; and that a congress should in four months be opened at
Aix-la-Chapelle, for adjusting all differences, and consolidating the
peace of Europe. This congress was afterwards transferred to Soissons,
for the conveniency of the French minister, whose presence was
necessary at court. The siege of Gibraltar was raised, after it had
lasted four months, during which the Spaniards lost a great number of
men by sickness, while the garrison sustained very little damage. The
court of Madrid, however, started some new difficulties, and for some
time would not consent to the restitution of the South-Sea ship, which
had been detained at La Vera-Cruz, in the West Indies; so that sir
Charles Wager continued to cruise on the coast of Spain: but these
objections were removed in the sequel.

<h2>
    DEATH AND CHARACTER OF GEORGE I.
</h2>
<p>
King George, having appointed a regency, embarked at Greenwich on the
third day of June, and landing in Holland on the seventh, set out on his
journey to Hanover. He was suddenly seized with a paralytic disorder on
the road: he forthwith lost the faculty of speech, became lethargic, and
was conveyed in a state of insensibility to Osnabruck. There he expired
on Sunday the eleventh day of June, in the sixty-eighth year of his age,
and in the thirteenth of his reign.&mdash;George I. was plain and simple in
his person and address, grave and composed in his deportment, though
easy, familiar, and facetious in his hours of relaxation. Before he
ascended the throne of Great Britain, he had acquired the character of a
circumspect general, a just and merciful prince, a wise politician, who
perfectly understood, and steadily pursued, his own interest. With these
qualities, it cannot be doubted but that he came to England extremely
well disposed to govern his new subjects according to the maxims of
the British constitution, and the genius of the people; and if ever he
seemed to deviate from these principles, we may take it for granted that
he was misled by the venal suggestions of a ministry whose power and
influence were founded on corruption. <a href="#note-229" name="noteref-229">229</a> <i>[See note 2 I, at the end of

[ Note 2 H, p. 206. The pretender, who resided at Urbino,
having received intelligence from Paris, that there was a design formed
against his life, pope Clement XL gave directions that all foreigners in
that neighbourhood, especially English, should be arrested. The earl of
Peterborough arriving at Bologna, with a few armed followers, was seized
with all his papers. Being interrogated, he said he came to pass some
time in Italy for the benefit of the air. He was close confined for
a whole month in fort Urbino, and his attendants were sent to prison.
Nothing appearing to justify the suspicion, he was dismissed with
uncommon civility. The king demanding reparation for this insult, the
pope wrote with his own hand a letter to an ally of Great Britain,
declaring that the legate of Bologna had violently and unjustly, without
the knowledge of his holiness, caused the earl of Peterborough to be
seized upon suspicions which proved to be ill-grounded. The cardinal
legate sent a declaration to the English admiral in the Mediterranean,
that he had asked forgiveness of his holiness, and now begged pardon of
his Britannic majesty, for having unadvisedly arrested a peer of Great
Britain on his travels.]

[ Note 2 I, p. 229. George I. married the princess Sophia
Dorothy, daughter and heiress of the duke of Zell, by whom he had king
George II. and the late queen of Prussia. The king's body was conveyed
to Hanover, and interred among his ancestors. From the death of Charles
II. to this period, England had made a considerable figure in every
branch of literature. Dr. Atterbury and Dr. Clarke distinguished
themselves in divinity&mdash;Mr. Whiston wrote in defence of Arianism&mdash;John
Locke shone forth the great restorer of human reason&mdash;the earl
of Shaftesbury raised an elegant, though feeble, system of moral
philosophy&mdash;Berkeley, afterwards bishop of Cloyne in Ireland, surpassed
all his contemporaries in subtle and variety of metaphysical arguments,
as well as in the art of deduction&mdash;lord Bolingbroke's talents as
a metaphysician have been questioned since his posthumous works
appeared&mdash;great progress was made in mathematics and astronomy, by
Wallis, Halley, and Flamstead&mdash;the art of medicine owed some valuable
improvements to the classical Dr. Friend, and the elegant Dr. Mead.
Among the poets of this era, we number John Philips, author of a
didactic poem, called Cyder, a performance of real merit; he lived and
died in obscurity&mdash;William Congreve, celebrated for his comedies, which
are not so famous for strength of character and power of humour, as for
wit, elegance, and regularity&mdash;Vanburgh, who wrote with more nature and
fire, though with less art and precision&mdash;Steele, who in his comedies
successfully engrafted modern characters on the ancient drama&mdash;Farquhar,
who drew his pictures from fancy rather than from nature, and whose
chief merit consists in the agreeable pertness and vivacity of his
dialogue&mdash;Addison, whose fame as a poet greatly exceeded his genius,
which was cold and enervate; though he yielded to none in the character
of an essayist, either for style or matter&mdash;Swift, whose muse seems to
have been mere misanthropy; he was a cynic rather than a poet, and his
natural dryness and sarcastic severity would have been unpleasing, had
not he qualified them, by adopting the extravagant humour of Lueian and
Rabelais&mdash;Prior, lively, familiar, and amusing&mdash;Rowe, solemn, florid,
and declamatory&mdash;Pope, the prince of lyric poetry; unrivalled in
satire, ethics, and polished versification&mdash;the agreeable Parnel&mdash;the
wild, the witty, and the whimsical Garth&mdash;Gay, whose fables may vie with
those of La Fontaine, in native humour, ease, and simplicity, and whose
genius for pastoral was truly original. Dr. Bentley stood foremost in
the list of critics and commentators. Sir Christopher Wren raised some
noble monuments of architecture. The most remarkable political
writers were Davenant, Hare, Swift, Steele, Addison, Bolingbroke, and
Trenchard.]
